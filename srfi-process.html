<p>by Dave Mason</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The goal of this mechanism is to provide a permanent registry for
<em>Scheme Requests For Implementation</em> (SRFIs — pronounced "surfie").
This is not a formal standards-creation mechanism.  Rather, it is a formal way
to manage the production of proposals for Scheme.</p>

<p>There are many other things that this process is not.  Discussion of those,
rationales for some of the implementation details, and answers to related
questions are to be found in the <a href="srfi-faq.html">SRFI FAQ page</a>.</p>

<p>Related to this process is a Scheme special form, documented in <a href=
"srfi-7/">SRFI 7</a>, that a Scheme program can use to ascertain whether an
implementation supports a particular standard or feature.</p>

<h2>Mechanism</h2>

<p>The site <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/"><code>http://srfi.schemers.org/</code></a>
will provide an archive of <em>draft</em>, <em>final</em> and <em>withdrawn</em>
SRFIs and a submission process to submit SRFIs for consideration.</p>

<p>The editors of the SRFIs will be experienced members of the Scheme community
independent of the major implementors.  They will attempt to keep the quality of
SRFIs high, but will ultimately accept any SRFI which conforms to the
<a href="#structure">structure requirements</a> below.</p>

<p>A moderated mailing list, <code>srfi-announce at srfi dot schemers dot
org</code>, will be used to announce when new SRFI proposals become
<em>drafts</em>.  It will carry a final notification when the SRFI has been
either <em>final</em> or <em>withdrawn</em>.  Anyone can subscribe to the list,
and implementors are especially encouraged to subscribe.</p>

<p>There will be a mailing list created for the evaluation period of each SRFI
where all discussion of the proposal will take place.  Anyone may join these
lists.  The discussion will be archived and the archived discussion will remain
part of the permanent record of the SRFI.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<!-- In order for the SRFI process to be as open and transparent as possible, -->

<p>All proposals must follow the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Authors submit a proposal by sending email to <a href=
  "mailto:srfi%20minus%20editors%20at%20srfi%20dot%20schemers%20dot%20org"><code>
    srfi minus editors at srfi dot schemers dot org</code></a>.

  <li>Within seven days, one of the editors will read and respond to the
  proposal.  The response may be a request to clarify, justify, or withdraw the
  proposal.  Such a request must not reflect the personal bias of an editor.
  Rather, it will be made strictly to maintain a high quality of submissions.
  The editors may not turn a proposal back more than twice.  On the third
  submission, the editors will move the proposal to <em>draft</em> status if it
  conforms to the specification below.  At the discretion of the editors, a
  proposal that does not completely conform may be moved to <em>draft</em>
  status.  Every proposal must conform before it is moved to <em>final</em>
  status.

  <li>When the proposal has been vetted by the editors, it receives its SRFI
  number and becomes <em>draft</em>.  The editors will create a mailing list for
  the discussion of the proposal.  A short notice of the new draft SRFI,
  including the title and abstract, SRFI number, URL, and instructions to
  access the SRFI's mailing list, will be sent to <code>srfi minus announce at
  srfi dot schemers dot org</code>.  As part of the initial editing process, the
  editors will ensure that related standards (R<sup>n</sup>RS, SRFIs, RFCs and
  others) are appropriately identified and that the proposal meets the
  structural requirements described below.  If other related standards are
  identified during the comment process or after acceptance, the editors will
  keep the references up-to-date.  A proposal cannot normally be finalized until
  <strong>60 days</strong> have passed since its initial submission.

  <li>
    <p>If the authors choose, they may submit revised versions of the proposal
      at any point during the comment period.  Every such revision shall be
      announced to the SRFI's mailing list, and all revisions will be retained in
      the permanent record of the SRFI.</p>

    <p>The SRFI process used to set a hard limit of ninety days on the
      discussion period.  This was done because "Active discussion or
      revision after 90 days normally suggests that a proposal has
      been revised at least three times and is not yet mature enough
      for standardization."  The current editor has removed this
      limit, but <strong>strongly encourages authors to submit SRFIs
      that they believe will only take ninety days</strong>, and <strong>reserves
      the right to withdraw SRFIs if authors become unresponsive</strong>.

  <li>At any time during the comment period, the authors can choose to withdraw
  the proposal.  If the editors determine that insufficient time for discussion
  has followed a significant revision of the proposal, the proposal will be
  withdrawn.  Otherwise, the proposal will be made final if it meets the
  requirements below.  The outcome will be announced to <code>srfi minus
  announce at srfi dot schemers dot org</code>.

  <li>If the SRFI is withdrawn at the end of the comment period, it will be
  moved to a <em>withdrawn</em> proposal archive.  Subsequent related proposals
  by the same or different authors may include/modify the text of the withdrawn
  proposal, and may include references to it.

  <li>When the authors are ready to submit an SRFI for finalization,
    they may, at their discretion, ask the editors to announce a "last
    call" period.  This is a period, typically a week, in which
    reviewers on the mailing list are encouraged to submit their final
    comments.  The hope is that all substantial issues have already
    been resolved, and that the last call period will just encourage
    people on the mailing list to do one final check.  If authors are
    confident that discussion of the SRFI is already finished, they
    may request finalization without a last call period.</li>

  <li>When the SRFI is accepted, it will be placed on the list of
  <em>final</em> SRFIs.  This will include a link to the history of the
  proposal, including all earlier versions and the archive of the discussion
  from the comment period.  Any identified SRFIs that are superseded by or
  incompatible with the newly final SRFI will be updated to reflect this fact.

  <li>A final SRFI may later be withdrawn, but only if it has been replaced
  with a newer SRFI and the author of the original SRFI agrees.  In that case,
  there will be a "See also" link from the withdrawn SRFI to the new one.  Note
  that withdrawn SRFIs are still present on the web site, in full — just marked
  withdrawn.
</ol>

    <figcaption>SRFI state transitions</figcaption></figure>

<p>Once the SRFI number has been assigned, the proposal will be in one of three
states: <em>draft</em>, <em>final</em>, or <em>withdrawn</em>.  Lists of
proposals in all three states will be available and archived indefinitely, and
SRFI numbers will not be reused.  The only changes that may be made to a
<em>final</em> SRFI are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>updating of URLs (including those of related SRFIs)

  <li>noting that the SRFI has been deprecated or has been superseded by a
  subsequent SRFI

  <li>withdrawing the SRFI, but only with permission of the author, and only if
  a replacement SRFI has been finalized

  <li>improving the sample implementation and tests

  <li>correcting errors (but not errors of design), e.g. spelling errors,
  typos, or contradictory statements

  <li>adding "post-finalization notes," which document later
    recommendations by the authors and are placed in the Status
    section
</ol>

<p>Every Scheme implementation is encouraged to provide implementations of
final SRFIs where possible, and to retain existing implementations of
deprecated SRFIs for a reasonable time period.</p>

<p>New standards, such as R<sup>n</sup>RS, may supersede or conflict with
existing SRFIs.  The editors and authors will work to update the relationship of
active SRFIs to such standards.<a id="structure"></a></p>

<h3 id="errata">Errata</h3>

<p>Anyone who finds an error should report it to the SRFI's
  discussion mailing list.  That way, it will be recorded
  publicly.</p>

<p>If the author agrees to a correction and it is
  straightforward, we'll revise the document itself.  See the
  example of
  <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-158/srfi-158.html">SRFI
    158</a>.</p>

<p>Otherwise, or until the author has expressed an opinion, we
  add a link to an errata page to the Status section.  See the
  example of <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-48/srfi-48.html">SRFI
  48</a> (<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-48/errata.html">SRFI 48
  errata</a>).  That way, the document remains unchanged, but
  everyone can easily find the correction.</p>

<p>In either case, a tag like <code>errata-1</code> is added in
  the Git repository.</p>


<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>Every SRFI must meet the following requirements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It must have a succinct title.

  <li>It must list the authors.

  <li>It must list related standards and SRFIs, including dependencies,
  conflicts, and replacements.

  <li>It must begin with an abstract.  This will be fewer than 200 words long.
  It will outline the need for, and design of, the proposal.

  <li>It must contain a detailed rationale.  This will typically be 200-500
  words long and will explain why the proposal should be incorporated as a
  standard feature in Scheme implementations.  If there are other standards
  which this proposal will replace or with which it will compete, the rationale
  should explain why the present proposal is a substantial improvement.
  <li id="detailed-spec">It must contain a detailed specification.  This should
  be detailed enough that a conforming implementation could be completely
  created from this description.

  <li>It must contain a sample implementation.  This requirement may be met (in
  order from the most to the least preferred) by:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>A portable Scheme implementation (possibly using earlier SRFIs).  This
      is the most desirable option, because then implementors can provide a
      (possibly slow) implementation with no effort.

      <li>A mostly-portable solution that uses some kind of hooks provided in
      some Scheme interpreter/compiler.  In this case, a detailed specification
      of the hooks must be included so that the SRFI is self-contained.

      <li>An implementation-specific solution.  Ideally, tricky issues that had
      to be dealt with in the implementation will be identified.

      <li>A separately available implementation, where a sample implementation
      is large or requires extensive modifications (rather than just additions)
      to an existing implementation.  This implementation will eventually be
      archived along with the SRFI and the discussion related to it.
      <li id="outline-impl">An outline of how it might be implemented.  This
      should be considered a last resort, and in this case the rationale for
      the feature must be stronger.
    </ol>

    <p>The sample implementation should normally conform to the specification
    in point 6 <a href="#detailed-spec">above</a>.  If there is any variance
    (such as the implementation being overly restrictive), the
    <strong>specification</strong> will be considered correct, the variance
    should be explained, and a timetable provided for the sample implementation
    to meet the specification.

    <p>The sample implementation should include automated tests.  Tests make
    porting to new Scheme implementations easier.  They also help users
    understand how your SRFI is to be used.  However, if the sample
    implementation is trivial or not really meant to be used, i.e. it is just a
    proof of concept, it's okay to omit tests.  That should be a rare case.  No
    specific test framework is required, but both SRFI 64 and SRFI 78 are
    available.

    <p>A SRFI may be submitted without an implementation so that the
    specification may be refined before effort is invested in implementing it.
    However, an implementation should be provided as soon as possible.

  <li>A proposal must be submitted in <strong>HTML</strong> (3.2 or later)
  format following the <a href="srfi-template.html">template located here</a>.
  All proposals must be written in English, be properly formatted, and
  be reasonably grammatical.

  <li>It must contain a copyright statement as follows (where <em>AUTHOR</em>
  should be replaced by the name(s) of the author(s) and <em>YEAR</em> will be
  the year in which the SRFI number is allocated):

    <blockquote>
      Copyright (C) <em>AUTHOR</em> (<em>YEAR</em>).

      a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the

      OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE
      USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
    </blockquote>

    <p>In addition to the SRFI document, any software written
      specifically for the SRFI should be published under the above
      license.  However, at the editors' discretion, the SRFI may
      reference software that was already written and published under
      another license, citing that software as its sample
      implementation.  The BSD 2- and 3-clause licenses are
      specifically allowed for this purpose.</p>
</ol>

<p>The editors may not reject a proposal because they disagree with the
importance of the proposal, or because they think it is a wrong-headed approach
to the problem.  The editors may, however, reject a proposal because it does not
meet the requirements listed here.</p>

<p>In particular, lack of a sample implementation (as defined above) is grounds
for rejection.  This can only occur if the "sample implementation" requirement
is being met by an outlined implementation (<a href="#outline-impl">type
5</a>), and there is consensus that the implementation outline is not adequate.
Note that this is never a permanent rejection, because creation of an
implementation of one of the other types is a complete refutation of this basis
for rejection.</p>

<p>The other likely basis for rejection is an inadequate design specification.
In this case, the editors will attempt to help the author(s) conform to the
requirements.</p>

<p>Remember, even if a proposal becomes a <em>final</em> SRFI, the need for it
must be compelling enough for implementors to decide to incorporate it into
their systems, or it will have been a waste of time and effort for everyone
involved.  If the quality of any SRFI is not high, the likelihood of
implementors adding this feature to their implementation is extremely low.</p>

<a id="definitions"></a>
<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>The following terms may be used in SRFIs with the
corresponding definitions: The term "a SRFI &lt;n&gt;-conformant
implementation" means an implementation of Scheme which conforms to the
specification described in SRFI &lt;n&gt;.</p>
