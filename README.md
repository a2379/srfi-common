# Scheme Requests for Implementation

**N.B.: This is not the official SRFI web site.  The official site is http://srfi.schemers.org/.**

**This repository matches the official site as of Thu 30 Apr 2015, but the mailing list archives are not included.  (They will be hosted elsewhere.)  Most documents are in the `gh-pages` branch so that they can be served directly from Github.**

**For more information on my proposal, see [Hosting](hosting-on-github.md).  Michael Sperber, current editor, has [approved my proposal](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.scheme.srfi.announce/117), so now the work begins in earnest!**

The "Scheme Requests for Implementation" (*SRFI*) process is a new
approach to helping Scheme users to write portable and yet useful
code.  It is a forum for people interested in coordinating libraries
and other additions to the Scheme language between implementations.
