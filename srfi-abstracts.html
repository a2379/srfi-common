<li><a href="srfi-0">SRFI <span class="number">0</span></a>: <span class="title">Feature-based conditional expansion construct</span>
<span class="abstract">
<p>
It is desirable that programs which depend on additions to standard
Scheme name those additions.  SRFIs provide the specifications of
these additions ("features"), and SRFI 0 provides the means to
actually check that these features are present in the Scheme system by
means of the <code>cond-expand</code> construct.  It is anticipated
that there will be two main classes of features:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>sets of value and syntax bindings</li>
<li>reader syntax extensions</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
("Reader syntax" refers to aspects of the syntax described by the
grammars in the Scheme reports.)
</p>

<p>
The former class of features will probably include most SRFIs,
exemplified by the list library specified in <a href="srfi-1/">SRFI
1</a>.  The latter class includes Unicode source code support and
different kinds of parentheses.
</p>

<p>
Control over the presence of individual features will vary over
different Scheme systems.  A given feature may be absent or
provided by default in some Scheme systems and in others some
mechanism (such as an "import" clause in the code or a program
configuration file, a command line option, a dependency declaration in
a module definition, etc.) will be required for the feature to
be present in the system.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, in some systems a given feature may be in effect
throughout the entire program if it is in effect anywhere at all.  Other
systems may have more precise mechanisms to control the scope of a
feature (this might be the case for example when a module system is
supported).  In general it is thus possible that a feature is
in effect in some parts of the program and not in others.  This
allows conflicting SRFIs to be present in a given program as long
as their scope do not intersect.
</p>

<p>
SRFI 0 does not prescribe a particular mechanism for controlling the
presence of a feature as it is our opinion that this should be the
role of a module system.  We expect that future module system SRFIs
will need to extend the semantics of SRFI 0 for their purposes, for
example by defining feature scoping rules or by generalizing the
feature testing construct.

<span class="abstract">
  <p>This SRFI describes a set of datatypes for vectors whose elements are
of the same numeric type (signed or unsigned exact integer or inexact
real of a given precision).  These datatypes support operations
analogous to the Scheme vector type, but they are distinct datatypes.
An external representation is specified which must be supported by the
<code>read</code> and <code>write</code> procedures and by the program
parser (i.e. programs can contain references to literal homogeneous
vectors).</p>

<span class="abstract">
<p>The <i>named-let</i> incarnation of the <code>let</code> form has two slight
inconsistencies with the <code>define</code> form.  As defined, the <code>let</code>
form makes no accommodation for rest arguments, an issue of functionality
and consistency.  As defined, the <code>let</code> form does not accommodate
signature-style syntax, an issue of aesthetics and consistency.  Both
issues are addressed here in a manner which is compatible with the traditional
  <code>let</code> form but for minor extensions.</p>

<li><a href="srfi-7">SRFI <span class="number">7</span></a>: <span class="title">Feature-based program configuration language</span>
<span class="abstract">
<p>
This SRFI describes a configuration language to be used for specifing
the set of Scheme features or extensions required to run a program.
In addition to a list of required features, a program may also contain
Scheme code to be used only when a particular feature or combination of
features is available.
</p>

<p>
The configuration language is entirely distinct from Scheme; it is
neither embedded in Scheme nor includes Scheme as a subset.

<span class="abstract">

<li><a href="srfi-9">SRFI <span class="number">9</span></a>: <span class="title">Defining Record Types</span>
<span class="abstract">
<p>This SRFI describes syntax for creating new data types, called record types.
A predicate, constructor, and field accessors and modifiers are defined for
each record type.  Each new record type is distinct from all existing types,
including other record types and Scheme's predefined types.</p>

<span class="abstract">
<P>The present SRFI proposes an extensible external representation of
Scheme values, a notational convention for future SRFIs. This SRFI
adds <CODE>#,(</CODE> as a new token and extends production rules of
the grammar for a Scheme reader. The <CODE>#,()</CODE> form can be
used for example to denote values that do not have a convenient
printed representation, as well for conditional code compilation. It
is proposed that future SRFIs that contain new read syntax for values
use the <CODE>#,()</CODE> notation with an appropriate tag symbol.</P>
<P>As a particular example and the reference implementation for the
<CODE>#,()</CODE> convention, this SRFI describes an interpretation of
the <CODE>#,()</CODE> external form as a read-time application.

<span class="abstract">
<p>The SRFI defines exception-handling constructs for Scheme, including
<UL>

 <LI> the CURRENT-EXCEPTION-HANDLER procedure for obtaining the
   current exception-handling procedure,</LI>

 <LI> the WITH-EXCEPTION-HANDLER procedure and HANDLE-EXCEPTIONS form
   for installing an exception-handling procedure,</LI>

 <LI> the ABORT and SIGNAL procedures for raising exceptions, and</LI>

 <LI> constructs for creating and inspecting <EM>condition</EM>
   values, which encapsulate information about an exception.</LI>

</UL></p>

<P>

This SRFI requires a Scheme implementation to raise an exception
whenever an error is to be signaled or whenever the system determines
that evaluation cannot proceed in a manner consistent with the
semantics of Scheme. However, this SRFI does not define the
information to be supplied by an implementation for each possible kind
of exception; such a specification is left open for future SRFIs.

<li><a href="srfi-14">SRFI <span class="number">14</span></a>: <span class="title">Character-set Library</span>
<span class="abstract">
<p>The ability to efficiently represent and manipulate sets of characters is an
unglamorous but very useful capability for text-processing code -- one that
tends to pop up in the definitions of other libraries.  Hence it is useful to
specify a general substrate for this functionality early.  This SRFI defines a
general library that provides this functionality.</p>

<p>It is accompanied by a reference implementation for the spec. The reference
implementation is fairly efficient, straightforwardly portable, and has a
"free software" copyright. The implementation is tuned for "small" 7 or 8
bit character types, such as ASCII or Latin-1; the data structures and
algorithms would have to be altered for larger 16 or 32 bit character types
such as Unicode -- however, the specs have been carefully designed with these
larger character types in mind.</p>

<p>Several forthcoming SRFIs can be defined in terms of this one:

  <li> string library</li>
  <li> delimited input procedures (<em>e.g.</em>, <code>read-line</code>)</li>

<li><a href="srfi-17">SRFI <span class="number">17</span></a>: <span class="title">Generalized set!</span>
<span class="abstract">
<p>This is a proposal to allow procedure calls that evaluate
to the "value of a location" to be used to <em>set</em>
the value of the location, when used as the first
operand of <code>set!</code>.</p>
For example:
<pre>
(set! (car x) (car y))
</pre>
becomes equivalent to
<pre>
(set-car! x (car y))
</pre>

<p>
      Many programming languages have the concept of an <i>lvalue</i>.
that is an "expression" that "evaluates" to a location, and
which can appear on the left-hand-side of an assignment.
Common Lisp has a related concept of "generalized variables"
which can be used in <code>setf</code> and some other special forms.
However, the Common Lisp concept is based on the idea of
compile-time recognition of special "location-producing" functions;
this does not seem to be in the "spirit of Scheme".</p>
<p>
This SRFI proposes an extension of <code>set!</code>
so that it provides similar functionality as Common Lisp's <code>setf</code>,
except that the updater is associated with a procedure value,
rather than a name.</p>

<p>
A core set of procedures for creating and manipulating heterogeneous
multidimensional arrays is proposed. The design is consistent with the
rest of Scheme and independent of other container data types. It
provides easy sharing of parts of an array as other arrays without
copying, encouraging a declarative style of programming.
</p>

<p>
The specification is based on an original contribution by Alan Bawden
in 1993.

</span></li>
<li><a href="srfi-26">SRFI <span class="number">26</span></a>: <span class="title">Notation for Specializing Parameters without Currying</span>
<span class="abstract">
<p>When programming in functional style,
it is frequently necessary to specialize some of the
parameters of a multi-parameter procedure.
For example, from the binary operation <code>cons</code>
one might want to obtain the unary operation
<code>(lambda (x) (cons 1 x))</code>.
This specialization of parameters is also known as
"partial application", "operator section" or "projection".</p>

<p>The mechanism proposed here allows to write this sort
of specialization in a simple and compact way.
The mechanism is best explained by a few examples:</p>

<TABLE>
<TR>
  <TD><code>(cut cons (+ a 1) &lt;&gt;)</code></TD>
  <TD>is the same as</TD>
  <TD><code>(lambda (x2) (cons (+ a 1) x2))</code></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD><code>(cut list 1 &lt;&gt; 3 &lt;&gt; 5)</code></TD>
  <TD>is the same as</TD>
  <TD><code>(lambda (x2 x4) (list 1 x2 3 x4 5))</code></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD><code>(cut list)</code></TD>
  <TD>is the same as</TD>
  <TD><code>(lambda () (list))</code></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD><code>(cut list 1 &lt;&gt; 3 &lt;...&gt;)</code></TD>
  <TD>is the same as</TD>
  <TD><code>(lambda (x2 . xs) (apply list 1 x2 3 xs))</code></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD><code>(cut &lt;&gt; a b)</code></TD>
  <TD>is the same as</TD>
  <TD><code>(lambda (f) (f a b))</code></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<p>As you see, the macro <code>cut</code> specializes some of the
parameters of its first argument.
The parameters that are to show up as formal
variables of the result are indicated by the symbol <code>&lt;&gt;</code>,
pronouced as "slot". In addition, the symbol <code>&lt;...&gt;</code>,
pronounced as "rest-slot", matches all residual arguments of a variable
argument procedure.
As you can see from the last example above, the first argument can also
be a slot, as one should expect in Scheme.</p>

<p>In addition to <code>cut</code>, there is a variant called <code>cute</code>
(a mnemonic for "<code>cut</code> with evaluated non-slots") which evaluates
the non-slot expressions at the time the procedure is specialized, not at
the time the specialized procedure is called.
For example,</p>

<TABLE>
<TR>
  <TD><code>(cute cons (+ a 1) &lt;&gt;)</code></TD>
  <TD>is the same as</TD>
  <TD><code>(let ((a1 (+ a 1))) (lambda (x2) (cons a1 x2)))</code></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<p>As you see from comparing this example with the first example above,
the <code>cute</code>-variant will evaluate <code>(+ a 1)</code>
once, while the <code>cut</code>-variant will evaluate it during
every invokation of the resulting procedure.</p>

<p>The mechanism proposed in this SRFI allows specializing any subset
of the variables of a procedure.
The result can be of fixed arity or of variable arity.
The mechanism does not allow permutation, omission, duplication
or any other processing of the arguments;
for this it is necessary to write to use a different
  mechanism such as <code>lambda</code>.</p></span></li>

<li><a href="srfi-27">SRFI <span class="number">27</span></a>: <span class="title">Sources of Random Bits</span>
<span class="abstract">
  <p>This document specifies an interface to sources of random bits,
or "random sources" for brevity.
In particular, there are three different ways to use the interface,
with varying demands on the quality of the source and the
    amount of control over the production process:</p>

<UL>
<LI>
The "no fuss" interface specifies that
<code>(random-integer </code><I>n</I><code>)</code>
produces the next random integer in {0, ..., <I>n</I>-1} and
<code>(random-real)</code> produces the next random
real number between zero and one.
The details of how these random values are produced may not be
very relevant, as long as they appear to be sufficiently random.</LI>
<LI>
For simulation purposes, on the contrary, it is usually necessary
to know that the numbers are produced deterministically by a pseudo
random number generator of high quality and to have explicit access
to its state.
In addition, one might want to use several independent sources of
random numbers at the same time and it can be useful to have some
simple form of randomization.</LI>
<LI>
For security applications a serious form of true randomization
is essential, in the sense that it is difficult for an adversary to
exploit or introduce imperfections into the distribution of random bits.
Moreover, the linear complexity of the stream of random bits is more
important than its statistical properties.
In these applications, an entropy source (producing truely random
bits at a low rate) is used to randomize a pseudo random number
generator to increase the rate of available bits.</LI>
</UL>
<p>

Once random sources provide the infrastructure to obtain
random bits, these can be used to construct other random deviates.
Most important are floating point numbers of various distributions
and random discrete structures, such as permutations or graphs.
As there is an essentially unlimited number of such objects (with
limited use elsewhere), we do not include them in this SRFI.
In other words, this SRFI is <em>not</em> about making
all sorts of random objects---it is about obtaining random
bits in a portable, flexible, reliable, and efficient way.

<li><a href="srfi-40">SRFI <span class="number">40</span></a>: <span class="title">A Library of Streams</span>
<span class="abstract">
<p>
Along with higher-order functions, one of the hallmarks of functional
programming is lazy evaluation.  A primary manifestation of lazy
evaluation is lazy lists, generally called streams by Scheme
programmers, where evaluation of a list element is delayed until its
value is needed.
</p>

<p>
The literature on lazy evaluation distinguishes two styles of
laziness, called even and odd.  Odd style streams are ubiquitous among
Scheme programs and can be easily encoded with the Scheme primitives
delay and force defined in R5RS.  However, the even style delays
evaluation in a manner closer to that of traditional lazy languages
such as Haskell and avoids an "off by one" error that is symptomatic
of the odd style.
</p>

<p>
This SRFI defines the stream data type in the even style, some
essential procedures and syntax that operate on streams, and motivates
our choice of the even style.  A companion SRFI 41 Stream Library
provides additional procedures and syntax which make for more
convenient processing of streams and shows several examples of their
use.

<span class="abstract">
<p align="justify"><font face="serif">Streams, sometimes
called lazy lists, are a sequential data structure containing elements
computed only on demand.  A stream is either null or is a pair
with a stream in its cdr.  Since elements of a stream are computed
only when accessed, streams can be infinite.  Once computed, the
value of a stream element is cached in case it is needed again.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="serif">Streams without
memoization were first described by Peter Landin in 1965.  Memoization
became accepted as an essential feature of streams about a decade later.
Today, streams are the signature data type of functional programming

<p align="justify"><font face="serif">This Scheme Request for Implementation describes
two libraries for operating on streams: a canonical set of stream primitives

<span class="abstract">
<p>Lazy evaluation is traditionally simulated in Scheme using
<code>delay</code> and <code>force</code>.  However, these
primitives are not powerful enough to express
a large class of lazy algorithms that are iterative.
Indeed, it is folklore in the Scheme community that
typical iterative lazy algorithms written using
<code>delay</code> and
<code>force</code> will often
require unbounded memory.</p>

<p>
Although varous modifications of <code>delay</code> and
<code>force</code> had been proposed to resolve this problem (see e.g., the
SRFI-40 discussion list)
they all fail some of the benchmarks provided below.  To our knowledge,
the current SRFI provides the first exhaustive solution to this problem.</p>


<p>
As motivation,
we first explain how the usual laziness encoding using only <code>delay</code>
and <code>force</code> will break the iterative behavior of typical
algorithms that would have been properly tail-recursive
in a true lazy language, causing the computation to require unbounded memory.</p>

<p>
The problem is then resolved by
introducing a set of three operations:
<pre>
    {<code>lazy</code>, <code>delay</code>, <code>force</code>}
</pre>
which allow the programmer to succinctly express lazy algorithms while
retaining bounded space behavior in cases that are properly tail-recursive.
A general
recipe for using these primitives is provided.  An additional procedure
<code>{eager}</code> is provided for the construction of
eager promises in cases where efficiency is a concern.</p>

<p>
Although this SRFI redefines <code>delay</code> and <code>force</code>,
the extension is conservative in the sense that the semantics of the subset {<code>delay</code>, <code>force</code>} in
isolation (i.e., as long as the program does not use <code>lazy</code>)
agrees with that in R5RS.  In other words, no program that uses the
R5RS definitions of delay and force will break if those definition are
replaced by the SRFI-45 definitions of delay and force.

<span class="abstract">
<p>This SRFI describes how to modify the <i>Revised Report</i> (<a
href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/">R5RS</a>) in
order to enable conforming implementations to use an extended
character set such as (but not limited to) <a
href="http://www.unicode.org">Unicode</a>.</p>

<p>Changes to some requirements of the report are recommended.
Currently, the <i>Revised Report</i> contains requirements which are
difficult or impossible to satisfy with some extended character sets.</p>

<p>New required procedures are proposed, specified, and included
in the reference implementation.  These procedures enable portable
Scheme programs to manipulate Scheme source texts and source data
accurately, even in implementations using extended character sets.</p>

<p>This SRFI concludes with some suggestions for implementors
interested in providing good Unicode support, using these suggestions
to illustrate how the proposed changes to the <i>Revised Report</i> can "play
out" in Unicode-based Scheme.</p>

<p>This SRFI does <b>not</b> attempt to provide a comprehensive
library for global text processing.   For example, one issue in global
text processing is the need for linguistically-sensitive,
locale-sensitive procedures for sorting strings.   Such procedures are
beyond the scope of this SRFI.    On the other hand, by making Scheme
compatible with extended character sets, this SRFI is a step in the
direction of permitting global text processing standard libraries to
be developed in a form portable across all conforming implementations.</p>

<p>This SRFI does <b>not</b> propose that implementations be required
to support Unicode or any other extended character set.  It does not
specify a representation for Unicode characters or strings.  It
<b>does</b> revise the specifications of the report so that
<code>char?</code> values <i>may be</i> Unicode (or other) characters.</p>

<p>The reference implementation included should prove to be easily
ported to and effective for all ASCII-only implementations and for
many implementations using an 8-bit character set which is an
extension of ASCII (it will require very minor modifications for each
particular implementation).  Other implementations may need to use a
different implementation.</p>

<p>This SRFI can be seen as an extension of the standard procedures
<tt>=</tt>, <tt>&lt;</tt>, <tt>char&lt;?</tt> etc. of
R<sup>5</sup>RS  -- or even as a replacement.
The primary design aspect in this SRFI is the separation of
<em>representing</em> a total order and <em>using it.</em>
For representing the order, we have chosen for truly 3-way
comparisons.
For using it we provide an extensive set of
operations, each of which accepts a procedure used for comparison.
Since these compare procedures are often optional,
comparing built-in types is as convenient as
R<sup>5</sup>RS ,
sometimes more convenient:
For example, testing if the integer index <em>i</em> lies in the
integer range {0, <tt>...</tt>, <em>n</em> <tt>-</tt> 1} can be written as
<tt>(&lt;=/&lt;? 0 i n)</tt>, implicitly invoking <tt>default-compare</tt>.</p>
<p>
As soon as new total orders are required,
the infrastructure provided by this SRFI is far more
convenient and often even more efficient than building
each total order from scratch.</p>
<p>
Moreover, in case Scheme users and implementors find this
mechanism useful and adopt it,
the benefit of having a uniform interface to total orders
to be used in data structures will manifest itself.
Most concretely, a new sorting procedure in the spirit of
this SRFI would have the interface
<tt>(my-sort [ <i>compare</i> ] <i>xs</i>)</tt>,
using <tt>default-compare</tt> if the optional <i>compare</i>
was not provided.
Then <tt>my-sort</tt> could be defined using the entire
infrastructure of this SRFI:
Efficient 2- and 3-way branching,
testing for chains and pairwise inequality,
min/max, and general order statistics.</p>

<li><a href="srfi-71">SRFI <span class="number">71</span></a>: <span class="title">Extended LET-syntax for multiple values</span>
<span class="abstract">
<p>This SRFI is a proposal for extending <code>let</code>,
<code>let*</code>, and <code>letrec</code>
for receiving multiple values.
The syntactic extension is fully compatible with the existing syntax.
It is the intention that single-value bindings,
i.e. <code>(let ((var expr)) ...)</code>, and
multiple-value binding can be mixed freely and conveniently.</p>
<p>
The most simple form of the new syntax is best explained by an example:
<pre>
(define (quo-rem x y)
  (values (quotient x y) (remainder x y)))

(define (quo x y)
  (let ((q r (quo-rem x y)))
    q))
</pre></p>
<p>The procedure <code>quo-rem</code> delivers two values to
its continuation. These values are received as <code>q</code>
and <code>r</code> in the <code>let</code>-expression of the
procedure <code>quo</code>.
In other words, the syntax of <code>let</code> is extended such
that several variables can be specified---and these variables
receive the values delivered by the expression <code>(quo-rem x y)</code>.</p>
<p>
The syntax of <code>let</code> is further extended to cases in which
a rest argument receives the list of all residual values.
Again by example,
<pre>
(let (((values y1 y2 . y3+) (foo x)))
   body)
</pre>
In this example, <code>values</code> is a syntactic keyword
indicating the presence of multiple values to be received,
and <code>y1</code>, <code>y2</code>, and <code>y3+</code>,
resp., are variables bound to the first value, the second value,
and the list of the remaining values, resp., as produced by
<code>(foo x)</code>.
The syntactic keyword <code>values</code> allows receiving
all values as in <code>(let (((values . xs) (foo x))) body)</code>.
It also allows receiving no values at all as in
<code>(let (((values) (for-each foo list))) body)</code>.</p>
<p>
A common application of binding multiple values is
decomposing data structures into their components.
This mechanism is illustrated in its most primitive form as follows:
The procedure <code>uncons</code> (defined below)
decomposes a pair <code>x</code> into its car and its cdr
and delivers them as two values to its continuation.
Then an extended <code>let</code> can receive these values:
<pre>
(let ((car-x cdr-x (uncons x)))
  (foo car-x cdr-x))
</pre></p>
<p>Of course, for pairs this method is probably neither faster
nor clearer than using the procedures <code>car</code>
and <code>cdr</code>.
However, for data structures doing substantial work upon
decomposition this is different: Extracting the element of
highest priority from a priority queue, while at the
same time constructing the residual queue,
can both be more efficient and more convenient than
doing both operations independently.
In fact, the <code>quo-rem</code> example illustrates this
point already as both quotient and remainder are probably
computed by a common exact division algorithm.
(And often caching is used to avoid executing this
algorithm twice as often as needed.)</p>
<p>
As the last feature of this SRFI, a mechanism is specified
to store multiple values in heap-allocated data structures.
For this purpose, <code>values->list</code> and <code>values->vector</code>
construct a list (a vector, resp.) storing all values delivered
by evaluating their argument expression.
Note that these operations cannot be procedures.

errors in procedural macros.  We propose an improved algorithm that avoids these problems.

</p></li><li>
 <h3>Reflective tower:</h3>
 <p>
We specify a reflective tower of arbitrary height,

<span class="abstract">
<p>
Scheme's arithmetic system was designed to allow a wide variety of
implementations.  After many years of implementation experience,
however, most implementations now fall into a small number of
categories, and the benefits of continued experimentation no longer
justify the confusion and portability problems that have resulted from
giving implementations so much freedom in this area.  Moreover, the
R5RS generic arithmetic is difficult to implement as efficiently as
purely fixnum or purely flonum arithmetic.  (Fixnum arithmetic is
typically limited-precision integer arithmetic implemented using
one or more representations that may be especially efficient on
the executing machine; flonum arithmetic is typically
limited-precision floating-point arithmetic using one or more
representations that may be especially efficient on the executing
machine.)</p>

<P>
This SRFI is an effort to extend and clarify the R5RS arithmetic to
make it more portable, more comprehensive, and enable faster programs.</P>

<P>
Furthermore, one of us (Sperber) has argued that Scheme's arithmetic
requires radical overhaul.  The other (Clinger) agrees that revisions
are needed.  Whether these revisions qualify as radical is best left
to the judgement of individual readers.</P>

<p>
This SRFI proposes to revise section 6.2 ("Numbers") of R5RS by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>requiring a Scheme implementation to provide the full tower,
    including exact rationals of arbitrary precision, exact
    rectangular complex numbers with rational real and imaginary
  parts, and inexact real and complex arithmetic</li>
<li>defining fixnum arithmetic (parameterized by precision)</li>
<li>defining flonum arithmetic (inexactly)</li>
<li>defining new procedures for performing exact arithmetic</li>
<li>defining new procedures for performing inexact arithmetic</li>
<li>describing the external representation and semantics of
    0.0, -0.0, infinities and NaNs for systems
    that implement inexact real arithmetic using IEEE binary
  floating point&lt;?</li>
<li>changing the specification of <code>eqv?</code> to
  behave more sensibly with inexact numbers</li>
<li>defining Scheme's real numbers to be the complex numbers
  whose imaginary part is an exact zero</li>
<li>adding an external representation for inexact numbers
    that expresses the precision of a binary floating point
  representation</li>
<li>defining procedures for some new operations, including integer
  division and remainder on real numbers, and bitwise operations,</li>
<li>restricting the domains of some R5RS procedures</li>

<li><a href="srfi-78">SRFI <span class="number">78</span></a>: <span class="title">Lightweight testing</span>
<span class="abstract">
<p>A simple mechanism is defined for testing Scheme programs.
As a most primitive example, the expression

<PRE>
   (check (+ 1 1) => 3)
</PRE>

evaluates the expression <CODE>(+ 1 1)</CODE> and compares the result
with the expected result 3 provided after the syntactic
keyword <CODE>=&gt;</CODE>. Then the outcome of this comparison is reported
in human-readable form by printing a message of the form

<PRE>
   (+ 1 1) => 2 ; *** failed ***
   ; expected result: 3
</PRE></p>

Moreover, the outcome of any executed check is recorded
in a global state counting the number of correct and failed
checks and storing the first failed check. At the end of a
file, or at any other point, the user can print a summary
using <CODE>check-report</CODE>.
<p>
In addition to the simple test above, it is also possible
to execute a parametric sequence of checks. Syntactically,
this takes the form of an eager comprehension in the sense
of <A HREF="srfi-42/">SRFI 42</A> [5]. For example,

<PRE>
   (check-ec (:range e 100)
             (:let x (expt 2.0 e))
             (= (+ x 1) x) => #f (e x))
</PRE>

This statement runs the variable <CODE>e</CODE> through {0..99} and
for each binding defines <CODE>x</CODE> as <CODE>(expt 2.0 e)</CODE>. Then it is
checked if <CODE>(+ x 1)</CODE> is equal to <CODE>x</CODE>, and it is expected that
this is not the case (i.e. expected value is <CODE>#f</CODE>). The
trailing <CODE>(e x)</CODE> tells the reporting mechanism to print
the values of both <CODE>e</CODE> and <CODE>x</CODE> in case of a failed check.
The output could look like this:

<PRE>
   (let ((e 53) (x 9007199254740992.0)) (= (+ x 1) x)) => #t ; *** failed ***
    ; expected result: #f
</PRE>

The specification of bindings to report, <CODE>(e x)</CODE> in the
example, is optional but very informative.

<UL>
<LI>A way to specify a different equality predicate (default is <CODE>equal?</CODE>).</LI>

Unlike the <code>values</code>/<code>call-with-values</code> mechanism of

values as a single value, namely a procedure.  Decomposition of
multiple values is done by simple application.  Each of the two
macros, <code>mu</code> and <code>nu</code>, evaluates to a procedure
that takes one procedure argument.  The <code>mu</code> and
<code>nu</code> can be compared with <code>lambda</code>.  While
<code>lambda</code> expression that consists of &lt;formals&gt; and &lt;body&gt;
requires some actual arguments later when the evaluated
<code>lambda</code> expression is called, <code>mu</code> and
<code>nu</code> expressions that consist of &lt;expression&gt;s
corresponding to actual arguments of <code>lambda</code> require
&lt;formals&gt; and &lt;body&gt;, that is, an evaluated <code>lambda</code>
expression, later when the evaluated <code>mu</code> and

<p>Over the past ten years, numerous libraries have been specified via
the Scheme Requests for Implementation process.  Yet until the recent
ratification of the Revised<sup>6</sup> Report on the Algorithmic
Language Scheme, there has been no standardized way of distributing or
relying upon library code.  Now that such a library system exists,
there is a real need to organize these existing SRFI libraries so that
they can be portably referenced.</p>

<p>This SRFI is designed to facilitate the writing and distribution of
code that relies on SRFI libraries.  It identifies a subset of
existing SRFIs that specify features amenable to provision (and
possibly implementation) as libraries (SRFI Libraries) and proposes a
naming convention for this subset so that these libraries may be
referred to by name or by number.

This SRFI proposes a better record system for use in R5RS,
ERR5RS, and R6RS programs.  The syntactic layer of this

<span class="abstract">
<p>Lisp-based languages, like Scheme, are almost the only
programming languages in modern use that do not support infix notation.
In addition, most languages allow infix expressions to be combined
with function call notation of the form
<code><var>f</var>(<var>x</var>)</code>.
This SRFI provides these capabilities, both for
developers who already use Scheme and want these conveniences,
and also for other developers who may choose to use other languages
in part because they miss these conveniences.
Scheme currently reserves <code>{</code>...<code>}</code>
&#8220;for possible future extensions to the language&#8221;.
We propose that <code>{</code>...<code>}</code> be used
to support &#8220;curly-infix-expression&#8221; notation as a homoiconic
infix abbreviation,
as a modification of the Scheme reader.
It is an abbreviation in much the same way that
<samp>&#39;x</samp> is an abbreviation for <samp>(quote&nbsp;x)</samp>.
</p>
<p>
A
<dfn>curly-infix list</dfn>
introduces a list whose visual presentation
can be in infix order instead of prefix order.
For example,
<samp>{n&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;5}</samp> &#8658; <samp>(&gt;&nbsp;n&nbsp;5)</samp>,
and
<samp>{a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b&nbsp;+&nbsp;c}</samp> &#8658;
<samp>(+&nbsp;a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c)</samp>.
By intent, there is no precedence, but e.g.,
<samp>{x&nbsp;+&nbsp;{y&nbsp;*&nbsp;z}}</samp>
maps cleanly to
<samp>(+&nbsp;x&nbsp;(*&nbsp;y&nbsp;z))</samp>.
Forms with mixed infix operators and other complications have
&#8220;<code>$nfx$</code>&#8221; prepended to
enable later processing, e.g.,
<samp>{4&nbsp;+&nbsp;5&nbsp;*&nbsp;6}</samp> &#8658;
<samp>($nfx$&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;5&nbsp;*&nbsp;6)</samp>.
Also, inside a curly-infix list (recursively),
expressions of the form <code><var>f</var>(</code>...<code>)</code> are simply
an abbreviation for <code>(<var>f</var>&nbsp;</code>...<code>)</code>.</p>

<p>Note that this is derived from the
&#8220;<a href="http://readable.sourceforge.net/">readable</a>&#8221;
project.
We intend to later submit at least one additional SRFI that will build on
top of this SRFI, but curly-infix-expressions are useful on their own.

<span class="abstract">
<p>
This SRFI describes a set of syntax extensions for Scheme,
called sweet-expressions (t-expressions),
that has the same descriptive power as s-expressions
but is designed to be easier for humans to read.
The sweet-expression syntax enables the use of syntactically-meaningful
indentation to group expressions (similar to Python),
and it builds on the infix and traditional function notation defined in
<a href="srfi-105/">SRFI-105 (curly-infix-expressions)</a>.
Unlike nearly all past efforts to improve s-expression readability,
sweet-expressions are
general (the notation is independent from any underlying semantic)
and homoiconic (the underlying data structure is clear from the syntax).
This notation was developed by the
&#8220;<a href="http://readable.sourceforge.net/">Readable Lisp S-expressions Project</a>&#8221; and
can be used for both programs and data.
</p>
<p>
Sweet-expressions can be considered
a set of additional abbreviations, just as <tt>'x</tt> already abbreviates
<tt>(quote&nbsp;x)</tt>.
Sweet-expressions and traditionally formatted s-expressions
can be freely mixed; this provides backwards compatibility,
simplifies transition, and enables developers to maximize readability.
Here is an example of a sweet-expression and its equivalent s-expression
(note that a sweet-expression reader would accept <em>either</em> format):

<span class="abstract">
<p>
In Scheme, strings are a mutable data type.
Although it "is an error"
(<abbr title="Revised<sup>5</sup> Report on Scheme">R5RS</abbr>
and
 <abbr title="Revised<sup>7</sup> Report on Scheme">R7RS</abbr>)
to use <code>string-set!</code>
on literal strings or on strings returned by <code>symbol-&gt;string</code>,
and any attempt to do so "should raise an exception"
(<abbr title="Revised<sup>6</sup> Report on Scheme">R6RS</abbr>),
all other strings are mutable.
</p>

<p>
Although many mutable strings are never actually mutated, the mere
possibility of mutation complicates specifications of libraries that
use strings, encourages precautionary copying of strings, and precludes
structure sharing that could otherwise be used to make procedures such
as <code>substring</code> and <code>string-append</code> faster and
more space-efficient.
</p>

<p>
This
<abbr title="Scheme Request for Implementation">SRFI</abbr>
specifies a new data type of immutable texts.
It comes with efficient and portable sample implementations
that guarantee O(1) indexing
for both sequential and random access, even in systems whose
<code>string-ref</code> procedure takes linear time.
</p>

<p>
The operations of this new data type include analogues for all
of the non-mutating operations on strings specified by
the R7RS and most of those specified by
<abbr title="String cursors"><a href="srfi-130/">SRFI 130</a></abbr>,
but the immutability of texts and
uniformity of character-based indexing simplify the
specification of those operations while avoiding several
inefficiencies associated with the mutability of Scheme's
strings.

  SRFI 9 and the compatible R7RS-small provide Scheme with record

  they allow the user to introduce new types, disjoint from all existing

  conservative extension to SRFI 9 and R7RS record types (in other words, the
  keyword <code>define-record-type</code> defined in this specification
  can serve as the equally named keyword from SRFI 9 and R7RS and can thus
  be safely exported from <code>(srfi 9)</code> and <code>(scheme base)</code>)

<span class="abstract">
<p>This attempts to solve the same issues with R7RS strings raised by
  <a href="srfi-135/">SRFI-135</a>,
  but with better integration with the Scheme language.</p>

<p>
We propose to retain the name <dfn>string</dfn> as
the type of sequences of Unicode characters (scalar values).
There are two standard subtypes of string:
<ul>
<li>Immutable strings, also called <dfn>istrings</dfn>, cannot be
modified after they have been created.  Calling <code>string-set!</code>
on an istring throws an error.
On the other hand, the core operations <code>string-ref</code> and
<code>string-length</code> are guaranteed to be O(1).</li>
<li>Mutable strings can be modified <q>in-place</q> using
<code>string-set!</code> and other operations.
However, <code>string-ref</code>, <code>string-set!</code>,
or <code>string-length</code> have no performance guarantees.
On many implementation they may take time proportional to the
length of the string.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>An implementation may support other kinds of strings.
For example on the Java platform it may be reasonable to
consider any instance of <code>java.lang.CharSequence</code> to be a string.</p>
<p>
The main part of the proposal specifies the default bindings of various procedure names,
as might be pre-defined in a REPL.  Specifically, some procedures
that traditionally return mutable strings are changed to return istrings.
We later discuss compatibility and other library issues.</p>

<span class="abstract">
<p>
Scheme, like ML, is a programming language with strict evaluation
while others, like Haskell, use lazy evaluation.  Scheme, however,
possesses the primitives <code>delay</code> and <code>force</code>
that make it possible to express lazy algorithms in the Scheme
programming language.
</p>

<p>
Lazy evaluation does not go well in conjunction with imperative,
non-functional, side effecting code.  It should, however, be
applicable in a purely functional setting.  This is the case for the
delayed evaluation model as described in the R7RS as long as no
dynamically bound variables, also known as parameter objects, are
present.  It is the purpose of this SRFI to rework the
specification in the R7RS so that lazy evaluation works with purely
functional code that makes use of dynamic environments.  This is done
by remembering the dynamic environment in effect when
the <code>delay</code> expression is evaluated.

<li><a href="srfi-156">SRFI <span class="number">156</span></a>: <span class="title">Syntactic combiners for binary predicates</span>
<span class="abstract">
<p>The power and universality of the prefix notation employed by Scheme
  and other dialects of Lisp can be intimidating. However, we find that
  there are occasions when prefix syntax can be confusing and lead to
  code that is not self-documenting. We have identified that one of such
  cases is the use of asymmetrical binary predicates.</p>

<p>Probably the most common examples are the numerical comparison
  predicates <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>
  and <code>&gt;</code>. It is non obvious, for instance, how the expression
  <code>(&lt; a b)</code> should be pronounced.</p>

<p>The problem gets more serious in the case of user-defined binary
  predicates. For example, in the expression <code>(divides? x y)</code>
  the role of arguments is unclear: we don't know whether the author
  of the <code>divides?</code> predicate intended it to check whether
  <code>x</code> divides <code>y</code> or whether <code>y</code>
  divides <code>x</code>.</p>

<p>And while there seems to exist a silent convention among Schemers
  to interpret predicates like <code>(has-something-to? x y)</code>
  as "<code>x</code> has something to <code>y</code>", we believe
  that this convention should be made explicit, and confirmed by
  the forms available in the language.</p>

<p>We therefore propose a thin layer of "syntactic stevia" that can
  be implemented using regular Scheme macros. We suggest, that the
  code <code>(is x &lt; y)</code> should be transformed
  to <code>(&lt; x y)</code>, and <code>(is x &lt; y &lt;= z)</code>
  -- to <code>(and (&lt; x y) (&lt;= y z))</code>. In addition, we
  suggest special meaning to the <code>_</code> symbol:
  <code>(is _ &lt; y)</code> and <code>(is x &lt; _)</code>
  should be transformed to <code>(lambda (_) (&lt; _ y))</code>
  and <code>(lambda (_) (&lt x _))</code>, respectively.
  This SRFI document also describes some other uses of the
  <code>is</code> macro and its limitations.</p></span></li></ul>
