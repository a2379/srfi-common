    <h1>Subscribing to a SRFI List</h1>

    There are individual mailing lists that are only active for the
    period when each SRFI is in draft state.  All discussion of a SRFI
    proposal should take place here, as not all interested parties
    participate in other venues such as comp.lang.scheme.

    <p>
      To subscribe to the mailing list for SRFI number <i>n</i>, send mail to
      <code>&lt;srfi minus <i>n</i> minus request at srfi dot schemers dot org&gt;</code>
      with the subject reading <code>subscribe</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To unsubscribe, send mail to the same address with
      the subject reading <code>unsubscribe</code>.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <p>Two additional lists exist:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><code>&lt;srfi minus announce at srfi dot schemers dot org&gt;</code></dt>
      <dd>This is a moderated mailing list
	where all announcements about new SRFI proposals and changes in
	status are posted.  To subscribe to this list, send mail to
	<code>&lt;<A HREF="mailto:srfi minus announce minus request at srfi dot schemers dot org">srfi minus announce minus request at srfi dot schemers dot org</A>&gt;</code>
	with the subject reading <code>subscribe</code>.</dd>

      <dt><code>&lt;srfi minus discuss at srfi dot schemers dot org&gt;</code></dt>
      <dd>This is an unmoderated mailing list
	for general discussion about the SRFI process.
	To subscribe to this list, send mail to
	<code>&lt;<A HREF="mailto:srfi minus discuss minus request at srfi dot schemers dot org">srfi minus discuss minus request at srfi dot schemers dot org</A>&gt;</code>
	with the subject reading <code>subscribe</code>.
	This list is archived 
	<a href="srfi-discuss/mail-archive/maillist.html">here</a>.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    
    <p>
      To unsubscribe, send mail to the respective <code>-request</code> address with
      the subject reading <code>unsubscribe</code>.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <p>Moreover, there is a pseudo-mailing list
      <code>&lt;srfi-auto-subscribe at srfi dot schemers dot org&gt;</code>.  Its
      subscribers automatically become subscribers of all future
      discussion mailing lists for Scheme Requests for Implementation.
      Therefore, there are no messages on this list itself.  To
      subscribe, send mail to
      <code>&lt;<A
	  HREF="mailto:srfi minus auto-subscribe-request at srfi dot schemers dot org">srfi minus auto-subscribe-request at srfi dot schemers dot org</A>&gt;</code>
      with the subject reading <code>subscribe</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To unsubscribe, send mail to the same address with
      the subject reading <code>unsubscribe</code>.
    </p>
