    <h1>Subscribing to a SRFI List</h1>

    There are individual mailing lists that are only active for the
    period when each SRFI is in draft state.  All discussion of a SRFI
    proposal should take place here, as not all interested parties
    participate in other venues such as comp.lang.scheme.

    <p>
      To subscribe to the mailing list for SRFI number <i>n</i>, send mail to
      <code>&lt;srfi-<i>n</i>-request@srfi.schemers.org&gt;</code>
      with the subject reading <code>subscribe</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To unsubscribe, send mail to the same address with
      the subject reading <code>unsubscribe</code>.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <p> In addition to the lists mentioned above, there is a moderated
      mailing list <code>&lt;srfi-announce@srfi.schemers.org&gt;</code>
      where all announcements about new SRFI proposals and changes in
      status are posted.  To subscribe to this list, send mail to
      <code>&lt;<A HREF="mailto:srfi-announce-request@srfi.schemers.org">srfi-announce-request@srfi.schemers.org</A>&gt;</code>
      with the subject reading <code>subscribe</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To unsubscribe, send mail to the same address with
      the subject reading <code>unsubscribe</code>.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <p>Moreover, there is a pseudo-mailing list
      <code>&lt;srfi-auto-subscribe@srfi.schemers.org&gt;</code>.  Its
      subscribers automatically become subscribers of all future
      discussion mailing lists for Scheme Requests for Implementation.
      Therefore, there are no messages on this list itself.  To
      subscribe, send mail to
      <code>&lt;<A
	  HREF="mailto:srfi-auto-subscribe-request@srfi.schemers.org">srfi-announce-request@srfi.schemers.org</A>&gt;</code>
      with the subject reading <code>subscribe</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To unsubscribe, send mail to the same address with
      the subject reading <code>unsubscribe</code>.
    </p>
