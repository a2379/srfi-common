      hallmarks of functional programming is lazy evaluation. A primary
      manifestation of lazy evaluation is lazy lists, generally called streams
      by Scheme programmers, where evaluation of a list element is delayed
      until its value is needed.
      <p>The literature on lazy evaluation distinguishes
      two styles of laziness, called even and odd. Odd style streams are
      ubiquitous among Scheme programs and can be easily encoded with the
      Scheme primitives delay and force defined in R5RS. However, the even
      style delays evaluation in a manner closer to that of traditional lazy
      languages such as Haskell and avoids an "off by one" error that is
      symptomatic of the odd style.
      <p>This SRFI defines the stream data type in the
      even style, some essential procedures and syntax that operate on streams,
      and motivates our choice of the even style. A companion SRFI 41 Stream
      Library provides additional procedures and syntax which make for more
      convenient processing of streams and shows several examples of their
      use.</div></li>

      functions from Scheme, calling Scheme functions from C, and allocating
      storage in the Scheme heap. Scheme manages stub functions in C that
      negotiate between the calling conventions of Scheme and C and the memory
      allocation policies of both worlds.
      <p>The following facilities are available for
      interfacing between Scheme and C:
      <ul>
        <li>Scheme code can call C functions.
        <li>The external interface provides full
        introspection for all Scheme objects. External code may inspect,
        modify, and allocate Scheme objects arbitrarily.
        <li>External code may signal errors to the
        Scheme system.
        <li>External code may call back into Scheme.
        Scheme correctly unrolls the process stack on non-local exits.
        <li>External modules may register bindings of
        names to values with a central registry accessible from Scheme.
        Conversely, Scheme code can register shared bindings for access by C
        code.
      </ul>
      <p>The interface is closely based on that of

      <i>Revised Report</i> (<a href=
      "http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/">R5RS</a>) in order to
      enable conforming implementations to use an extended character set such
      as (but not limited to) <a href=
      "http://www.unicode.org">Unicode</a>.
      <p>Changes to some requirements of the report are
      recommended. Currently, the <i>Revised Report</i> contains requirements
      which are difficult or impossible to satisfy with some extended character
      sets.
      <p>New required procedures are proposed,
      specified, and included in the reference implementation. These procedures
      enable portable Scheme programs to manipulate Scheme source texts and
      source data accurately, even in implementations using extended character
      sets.
      <p>This SRFI concludes with some suggestions for
      implementors interested in providing good Unicode support, using these
      suggestions to illustrate how the proposed changes to the <i>Revised
      Report</i> can "play out" in Unicode-based Scheme.
      <p>This SRFI does <b>not</b> attempt to provide a
      comprehensive library for global text processing. For example, one issue
      in global text processing is the need for linguistically-sensitive,
      locale-sensitive procedures for sorting strings. Such procedures are
      beyond the scope of this SRFI. On the other hand, by making Scheme
      compatible with extended character sets, this SRFI is a step in the
      direction of permitting global text processing standard libraries to be
      developed in a form portable across all conforming
      implementations.
      <p>This SRFI does <b>not</b> propose that
      implementations be required to support Unicode or any other extended
      character set. It does not specify a representation for Unicode
      characters or strings. It <b>does</b> revise the specifications of the
      report so that <code>char?</code> values <i>may be</i> Unicode (or other)
      characters.
      <p>The reference implementation included should
      prove to be easily ported to and effective for all ASCII-only
      implementations and for many implementations using an 8-bit character set
      which is an extension of ASCII (it will require very minor modifications
      for each particular implementation). Other implementations may need to
      use a different implementation.</div></li>

      allow a wide variety of implementations. After many years of
      implementation experience, however, most implementations now fall into a
      small number of categories, and the benefits of continued experimentation
      no longer justify the confusion and portability problems that have
      resulted from giving implementations so much freedom in this area.
      Moreover, the R5RS generic arithmetic is difficult to implement as
      efficiently as purely fixnum or purely flonum arithmetic. (Fixnum
      arithmetic is typically limited-precision integer arithmetic implemented
      using one or more representations that may be especially efficient on the
      executing machine; flonum arithmetic is typically limited-precision
      floating-point arithmetic using one or more representations that may be
      especially efficient on the executing machine.)
      <p>This SRFI is an effort to extend and clarify
      the R5RS arithmetic to make it more portable, more comprehensive, and
      enable faster programs.
      <p>Furthermore, one of us (Sperber) has argued
      that Scheme's arithmetic requires radical overhaul. The other (Clinger)

        inexact real and complex arithmetic
        <li>defining fixnum arithmetic (parameterized by
        precision)
        <li>defining flonum arithmetic
        (inexactly)
        <li>defining new procedures for performing exact

        inexact real arithmetic using IEEE binary floating point&lt;?
        <li>changing the specification of
        <code>eqv?</code> to behave more sensibly with inexact numbers
        <li>defining Scheme's real numbers to be the

        <li>adding an external representation for
