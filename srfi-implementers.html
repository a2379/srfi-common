    <h1>Scheme Systems Supporting SRFIs</h1>


The following systems are claimed to support one or more SRFIs:
<DL>
      <DT>Bigloo 2.0		<DD>1
      <DT>Bigloo 2.1c		<DD>1, 6, 8, 9
      <DT>Pocket Scheme 0.3.6	<DD>6
      <DT>stk 4.0.0		<DD>2, 6, 8

</DL>
Note that unless an implementation provides one of the availability
SRFIs, an application cannot <strong>completely</strong> portably move between
implementations.  The following scheme systems claim to implement the indicated
availability SRFIs:
<DL>
      <DT>Bigloo 2.0<DD>0
      <DT>stk 4.0.0<DD>0
</DL>
The SRFI editors are not responsible for verifying these claims, nor
the quality of the implementations.  If you are aware of support for
SRFIs in other Scheme systems, please inform the editors.
