      <p>This SRFI defines two related equivalence
      predicates that are recursive, not just partial recursive: they terminate
      on all arguments. One of these predicates, <code>equiv?</code>, is
      consistent with the <code>equal?</code> procedure described in the R5RS:
      Whenever <code>equal?</code> terminates, <code>equiv?</code> returns the
      same value as <code>equal?</code>.
