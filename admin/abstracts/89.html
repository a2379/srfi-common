      <p>This SRFI specifies the <code>define*</code> and
      <code>lambda*</code> special forms. These forms extend the R5RS
      <code>define</code> and <code>lambda</code> special forms to simplify the use of
      optional positional and named parameters. Optional positional parameters,
      optional named parameters and required named parameters are covered by
      this SRFI. The formal parameter list syntax specified in this SRFI is
      different from the syntax used by Common Lisp and the DSSSL languages but
      nevertheless offers similar functionality and a nicer syntax. Formal
      parameter lists which conform to the R5RS syntax have the same meaning as
      in R5RS.
