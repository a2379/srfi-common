  Continuation marks are a programming language feature that
  allows one to attach information to and retrieve information from
  continuations, generalizing stack inspection.  Conceptually, a
  continuation consists of a number of frames where each frame
  stands for an active procedure call that is not a tail call.  At
  most one mark for a given key can be attached to a single frame.

  Besides stack inspection, continuation marks can be used to
  implement dynamic scope, delimited continuations, or delayed
  evaluation that is able to handle iterative lazy algorithms.

  This SRFI proposes to add continuation marks to the Scheme
  programming language.
