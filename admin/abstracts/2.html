      <p>Like an ordinary AND, an AND-LET* special form
      evaluates its arguments -- expressions -- one after another in order,
      till the first one that yields #f. Unlike AND, however, a non-#f result
      of one expression can be bound to a fresh variable and used in the
      subsequent expressions. AND-LET* is a cross-breed between LET* and
      AND.
