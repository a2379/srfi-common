      <p>Many operating systems make the set of argument
      strings used to invoke a program available (often following the program
      name string in an array called argv). Most programs need to parse and
      process these argument strings in one way or another. This SRFI describes
      a set of procedures that support processing program arguments according
      to POSIX and GNU C Library Reference Manual guidelines.
