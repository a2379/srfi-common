      <p>When programming in functional style, it is
      frequently necessary to specialize some of the parameters of a
      multi-parameter procedure. For example, from the binary operation
      <code>cons</code> one might want to obtain the unary operation
      <code>(lambda (x) (cons 1 x))</code>. This specialization of parameters
      is also known as "partial application", "operator section" or
      "projection".
      <p>The mechanism proposed here allows to write
      this sort of specialization in a simple and compact way. The mechanism is
      best explained by a few examples:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><code>(cut cons (+ a 1) &lt;&gt;)</code>
          <td>is the same as
          <td><code>(lambda (x2) (cons (+ a 1) x2))</code>
        <tr>
          <td><code>(cut list 1 &lt;&gt; 3 &lt;&gt; 5)</code>
          <td>is the same as
          <td><code>(lambda (x2 x4) (list 1 x2 3 x4 5))</code>
        <tr>
          <td><code>(cut list)</code>
          <td>is the same as
          <td><code>(lambda () (list))</code>
        <tr>
          <td><code>(cut list 1 &lt;&gt; 3 &lt;...&gt;)</code>
          <td>is the same as
          <td><code>(lambda (x2 . xs) (apply list 1 x2 3 xs))</code>
        <tr>
          <td><code>(cut &lt;&gt; a b)</code>
          <td>is the same as
          <td><code>(lambda (f) (f a b))</code>
      </table>
      <p>As you see, the macro <code>cut</code>
      specializes some of the parameters of its first argument. The parameters
      that are to show up as formal variables of the result are indicated by
      the symbol <code>&lt;&gt;</code>, pronouced as "slot". In addition, the
      symbol <code>&lt;...&gt;</code>, pronounced as "rest-slot", matches all
      residual arguments of a variable argument procedure. As you can see from
      the last example above, the first argument can also be a slot, as one
      should expect in Scheme.
      <p>In addition to <code>cut</code>, there is a
      variant called <code>cute</code> (a mnemonic for "<code>cut</code> with
      evaluated non-slots") which evaluates the non-slot expressions at the
      time the procedure is specialized, not at the time the specialized
      procedure is called. For example,
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><code>(cute cons (+ a 1) &lt;&gt;)</code>
          <td>is the same as
          <td><code>(let ((a1 (+ a 1))) (lambda (x2) (cons a1 x2)))</code>
      </table>
      <p>As you see from comparing this example with the
      first example above, the <code>cute</code>-variant will evaluate <code>(+
      a 1)</code> once, while the <code>cut</code>-variant will evaluate it
      during every invokation of the resulting procedure.
      <p>The mechanism proposed in this SRFI allows
      specializing any subset of the variables of a procedure. The result can
      be of fixed arity or of variable arity. The mechanism does not allow
      permutation, omission, duplication or any other processing of the
      arguments; for this it is necessary to write to use a different mechanism
      such as <code>lambda</code>.
