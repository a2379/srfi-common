  <p>Many programming interfaces rely on a set of condition codes
  where each code has a numeric ID, a mnemonic symbol, and a
  human-readable message. This SRFI defines a facility to translate
  between numbers and symbols in a codeset and to fetch messages by
  code. Examples are given using the Unix <em>errno</em> and
  <em>signal</em> codesets.</p>
