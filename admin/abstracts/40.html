      <p>Along with higher-order functions, one of the
      hallmarks of functional programming is lazy evaluation. A primary
      manifestation of lazy evaluation is lazy lists, generally called streams
      by Scheme programmers, where evaluation of a list element is delayed
      until its value is needed.
      <p>The literature on lazy evaluation distinguishes
      two styles of laziness, called even and odd. Odd style streams are
      ubiquitous among Scheme programs and can be easily encoded with the
      Scheme primitives delay and force defined in R5RS. However, the even
      style delays evaluation in a manner closer to that of traditional lazy
      languages such as Haskell and avoids an "off by one" error that is
      symptomatic of the odd style.
      <p>This SRFI defines the stream data type in the
      even style, some essential procedures and syntax that operate on streams,
      and motivates our choice of the even style. A companion SRFI 41 Stream
      Library provides additional procedures and syntax which make for more
      convenient processing of streams and shows several examples of their
      use.
