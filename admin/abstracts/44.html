      <p>A Collections API which defines a common naming
      scheme and set of operations for creating, accessing, and manipulating
      common datastructures in Scheme. The API defines accessors, a common
      protocol for value access via generic and specific enumeration, and
      functions for inter-datastructure cooperation. Finally, a concrete
      specification of a compliant set of operators for the standard Scheme
      heterogenous datastructures (lists and vectors) and for the homogeneous
      Scheme string is provided.
