      This SRFI specifies a central log exchange for Scheme that
      connects log producers with log consumers. It allows multiple
      logging systems to interoperate and co-exist in the same
      program. Library code can produce log messages without knowledge
      of which log system is actually used. Simple applications can
      easily get logs on standard output, while more advanced
      applications can send them to a full logging system.
