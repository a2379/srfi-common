      <p>List queues are mutable ordered collections
      that can contain any Scheme object. Each list queue is based on an
      ordinary Scheme list containing the elements of the list queue by
      maintaining pointers to the first and last pairs of the list. It's cheap
      to add or remove elements from the front of the list or to add elements
      to the back, but not to remove elements from the back. List queues are
      disjoint from other types of Scheme objects.
