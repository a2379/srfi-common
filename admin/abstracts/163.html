<p>This is a specification of a reader form (literals)
  for multi-dimensional arrays.
  It is an extension of the Common Lisp array reader syntax to handle
  non-zero lower bounds, optional explicit bounds,
  and optional uniform element types (compatible with <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-4">SRFI 4</a>).
  It can be used in conjunction with <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-25">SRFI 25</a> or <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-122">SRFI 122</a>.
  These extensions were implemented in Guile (except the handling of rank-0 arrays),
  and later in Kawa.</p>
