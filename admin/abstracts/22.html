      <p>This SRFI describes basic prerequisites for
      running Scheme programs as Unix scripts in a uniform way. Specifically,
      it describes:
      <ul>
        <li>the syntax of Unix scripts written in
        Scheme,
        <li>a uniform convention for calling the Scheme
        script interpreter, and
        <li>a method for accessing the Unix command line
        arguments from within the Scheme script.
      </ul>
