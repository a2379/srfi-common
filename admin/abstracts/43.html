      <p>This SRFI proposes a comprehensive and complete
      library of vector operations accompanied by a freely available and
      complete reference implementation. The reference implementation is
      unencumbered by copyright, and useable with no modifications on any
      Scheme system that is R5RS-compliant. It also provides several hooks for
      implementation-specific optimization as well.
      <p>Because this SRFI is more of a library or
      module specification than a request for additions to readers or any other
      internal implementation detail, in an implementation that supports a
      module or structure or package or library or unit (et cetera) systems,
      these procedures should be contained in a module / structure / package /
      library / unit called <code>vector-lib</code>.
