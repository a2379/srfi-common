The host environment is the set of resources, such as the filesystem,
network and processes, that are managed by the operating system on top of
which a Scheme program is executing. This SRFI specifies some of the ways the host
environment can be accessed from within a Scheme program.  It does so by
leveraging widespread support for P<small>OSIX</small>, the Portable
Operating System Interface standardized by the IEEE.  Not all of the
functions of this SRFI are available on all operating systems.
