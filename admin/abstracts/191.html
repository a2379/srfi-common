<p>Many Scheme systems provide mechanisms for inspecting the arity of a
procedural value, making it a common feature, however there is no
standard interface.  As a result there is no portable way to observe
the arity of a procedure without actually applying it.  This
SRFI proposes a simple interface that is consistent with existing
Scheme systems' facilities and prior proposals.</p>
