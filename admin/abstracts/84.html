      <p>This SRFI proposes a social convention to allow
      programmers to easily create short, simple Scheme symbols which are
      guaranteed to be universally unique: No other programmer also following
      this SRFI will accidentally create a symbol eq? to yours.
      <p>Universally unique symbols are useful to
      identify standards, languages, libraries, types, classes, and other
      resources.
