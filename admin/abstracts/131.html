      <p>This SRFI is a reduced version of the SRFI 99
      syntactic layer that can be implemented with <code>syntax-rules</code>
      without requiring low-level macros. Like SRFI-99's syntax layer, it is
      backward compatible with the <code>define-record-type</code> macro from
      <a href="/srfi-9/">SRFI 9</a> or R7RS-small. It is forward compatible with
      <a href="/srfi-99/">SRFI 99</a>.
