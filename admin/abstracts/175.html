  <p>This SRFI defines ASCII-only equivalents to many of the
  character procedures in standard Scheme plus a few extra ones.
  Recent Scheme standards are based around Unicode but the
  significant syntactic elements in many file formats and network
  protocols are all ASCII. Such low-level code can run faster and
  its behavior can be easier to understand when it uses ASCII
  primitives.</p>
