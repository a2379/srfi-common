<p>The procedures of this SRFI allow callers to manipulate an object that maps keys to values
  without the caller needing to know exactly what the type of the object is.
  However, what procedures can be called on the object is partly determined by whether it is pure.
  Such an object is called a <em>dict(ionary)</em> in this SRFI.</p>
