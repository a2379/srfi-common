      <p>The ability to efficiently represent and
      manipulate sets of characters is an unglamorous but very useful
      capability for text-processing code -- one that tends to pop up in the
      definitions of other libraries. Hence it is useful to specify a general
      substrate for this functionality early. This SRFI defines a general
      library that provides this functionality.
      <p>It is accompanied by a reference implementation
      for the spec. The reference implementation is fairly efficient,
      straightforwardly portable, and has a "free software" copyright. The
      implementation is tuned for "small" 7 or 8 bit character types, such as
      ASCII or Latin-1; the data structures and algorithms would have to be
      altered for larger 16 or 32 bit character types such as Unicode --
      however, the specs have been carefully designed with these larger
      character types in mind.
      <p>Several forthcoming SRFIs can be defined in
      terms of this one:
      <ul>
        <li>string library
        <li>delimited input procedures (<em>e.g.</em>,
        <code>read-line</code>)
        <li>regular expressions
      </ul>
