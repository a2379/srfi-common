      <p>In Scheme, strings are a mutable data type.
      Although it "is an error" (<abbr title=
      "Revised&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Report on Scheme">R5RS</abbr> and
      <abbr title=
      "Revised&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Report on Scheme">R7RS</abbr>) to use
      <code>string-set!</code> on literal strings or on strings returned by
      <code>symbol-&gt;string</code>, and any attempt to do so "should raise an
      exception" (<abbr title=
      "Revised&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Report on Scheme">R6RS</abbr>), all
      other strings are mutable.
      <p>Although many mutable strings are never
      actually mutated, the mere possibility of mutation complicates
      specifications of libraries that use strings, encourages precautionary
      copying of strings, and precludes structure sharing that could otherwise
      be used to make procedures such as <code>substring</code> and
      <code>string-append</code> faster and more space-efficient.
      <p>This <abbr title=
      "Scheme Request for Implementation">SRFI</abbr> specifies a new data type
      of immutable texts. It comes with efficient and portable sample
      implementations that guarantee O(1) indexing for both sequential and
      random access, even in systems whose <code>string-ref</code> procedure
      takes linear time.
      <p>The operations of this new data type include
      analogues for all of the non-mutating operations on strings specified by
      the R7RS and most of those specified by <abbr title=
      "String cursors"><a href="/srfi-130/">SRFI 130</a></abbr>, but the
      immutability of texts and uniformity of character-based indexing simplify
      the specification of those operations while avoiding several
      inefficiencies associated with the mutability of Scheme's strings.
