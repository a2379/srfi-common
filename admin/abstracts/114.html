      <p>This proposal is a rewrite of <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-67/">SRFI 67</a>, Compare Procedures, extending it from procedures
      that represent a total order to procedure bundles that represent one or
      more of a total order, an equality predicate, and a hash function. By
      packaging these procedures together, along with a type test predicate,
      they can be treated as a single item for use in the implementation of
      data structures.
