      <p>We describe a syntax for defining record types.
      A predicate, constructor, and field accessors and modifiers may be
      specified for each record type. We also introduce a syntax for declaring
      record type schemes, representing families of record types that share a
      set of field labels. A polymorphic predicate and polymorphic field
      accessors and modifiers may be specified for each record type scheme. A
      syntax is provided for constructing records by field label, for in-place
      and for functional record update, and for composing records.
