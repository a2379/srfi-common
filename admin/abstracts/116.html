      <p>Scheme currently does not provide immutable
      pairs corresponding to its existing mutable pairs, although most uses of
      pairs do not exploit their mutability. The <a href="http://www.racket-lang.org">Racket</a> system takes the radical approach
      of making Scheme's pairs immutable, and providing a minimal library of
      mutable pairs with procedures named <code>mpair?, mcons, mcar, mcdr,
      set-mcar!, set-mcdr!</code>. This SRFI takes the opposite approach of
      leaving Scheme's pairs unchanged and providing a full set of routines for
      creating and dealing with immutable pairs. The sample implementation is
      portable (to systems with SRFI 9) and efficient.
