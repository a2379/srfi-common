      <p>This SRFI specifies an array mechanism for
      Scheme. Arrays as defined here are quite general; at their most basic, an
      array is simply a mapping, or function, from multi-indices of exact
      integers $i_0,\ldots,i_{d-1}$ to Scheme values. The set of multi-indices
      $i_0,\ldots,i_{d-1}$ that are valid for a given array form the
      <i>domain</i> of the array. In this SRFI, each array's domain consists of
      a rectangular interval
      $[l_0,u_0)\times[l_1,u_1)\times\cdots\times[l_{d-1},u_{d-1})$, a subset
      of $\mathbb Z^d$, $d$-tuples of integers. Thus, we introduce a data type
      called <i>intervals</i>, which encapsulate the cross product of nonempty
      intervals of exact integers. Specialized variants of arrays are specified
      to provide portable programs with efficient representations for common
      use cases.
