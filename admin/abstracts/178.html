<p>This SRFI describes a set of operations on
homogeneous bitvectors.
Operations analogous to those provided on the other homogeneous
vector types described in
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-160/srfi-160.html">SRFI 160</a>
are provided,
along with operations analogous to the bitwise operations of
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-151/srfi-151.html">SRFI 151</a>.
In addition,
a compact string representation compatible with Common Lisp is specified,
which may be supported by the <code>read</code> and <code>write</code>
procedures and by the program parser so that programs can contain
references to literal bitvectors.</p>
