      <p>The module system presented here is designed to
      let programmers share libraries, i.e., code that is intended to be
      incorporated into larger programs, and especially into programs that use
      library code from multiple sources. The module system supports macro
      definitions within modules, allows macro exports, and distinguishes the
      phases in which definitions and imports are needed. This SRFI defines a
      standard notation for libraries, a semantics for library expansion and
      execution, and a simple format for sharing libraries.
