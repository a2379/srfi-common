      <p>This SRFI defines an I/O layer similar in
      nature to the ports subsystem in R5RS, and provides conventional,
      imperative buffered input and output.
      <p>The layer architecture is similar to the upper
      three layers of the I/O subsystem in <a href=
      "http://www.standardml.org/Basis/">The Standard ML Basis
      Library</a>.
      <p>In particular, the subsystem fulfills the
      following requirements:
      <ul>
        <li>buffered reading and writing
        <li>binary and text I/O, mixed if needed
        <li>the ability to create arbitrary I/O ports
        from readers and writers
      </ul>
      <p>It builds on the Primitive I/O layer specified
      in <a href="/srfi-79/">SRFI 79 (Primitive I/O)</a>.
