<p>This SRFI provides two libraries for use with R7RS that provide a
way to sandbox the <code>eval</code> procedure to make it safer to use
in evaluating Scheme expressions of doubtful provenance.  The intention
is to call <code>eval</code>, passing it an S-expression representing a
Scheme procedure and the environment defined by one of these libraries.
Since code evaluated by <code>eval</code> runs in a null lexical
environment, the resulting procedure can then be invoked with less
concern about possible side effects.

<p><b>Use of these libraries does not provide any sort of safety
guarantee.  There are still many loopholes uncaught, including
attempts to process circular structure and over-allocation of memory.
The claim is only that the probability of such an attack is reduced,
not that it is eliminated.
However, using these libraries is a simple provision that is easy to
implement and easy to use.  For higher safety, it can readily be
combined with other provisions.
