<p>This SRFI provides two libraries for use with R7RS that provide a
way to sandbox the <code>eval</code> procedure to make it safer to use
in evaluating Scheme expressions of doubtful provenance.  The intention
is to call <code>eval</code>, passing it an S-expression representing a
Scheme procedure and the environment defined by one of these libraries.
Since code evaluated by <code>eval</code> runs in a null lexical
environment, the resulting procedure can then be invoked with less
concern about possible side effects.
