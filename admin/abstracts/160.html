<p>This SRFI describes a set of datatypes for vectors whose elements are
of the same numeric type (signed or unsigned exact integer or inexact
number of a given precision).  These datatypes support operations
analogous to the Scheme vector type, but they are distinct datatypes.
An external representation is specified which may be supported by the
<code>read</code> and <code>write</code> procedures and by the program
parser (i.e. programs can contain references to literal homogeneous
vectors).</p>
