<p>This SRFI describes a set of operations on SRFI 4 homogeneous vector
types (plus a few additional types) that are closely analogous
to the vector operations library,
<a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-133/srfi-133.html">
SRFI 133</a>.
An external representation is specified which may be supported by the
<code>read</code> and <code>write</code> procedures and by the program
parser so that programs can contain references to literal homogeneous
vectors.</p>
