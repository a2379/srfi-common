    <p>This SRFI defines atomic operations for the Scheme programming language.
      An <dfn>atomic operation</dfn> is an operation that, even in the presence
      of multiple threads, is either executed completely or not at all.  Atomic
      operations can be used to implement mutexes and other synchronization
      primitives, and they can be used to make concurrent algorithms lock-free.
      For this, this SRFI defines two data types, <dfn>atomic flags</dfn>
      and <dfn>atomic (fixnum) boxes</dfn>, whose contents can be queried and
      mutated atomically.  Moreover, each atomic operation comes with
      a <dfn>memory order</dfn> that defines the level of synchronization with
      other threads.</p>
