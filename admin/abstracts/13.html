      <p><abbr title="Revised^5 Report on Scheme">R5RS</abbr> Scheme has an impoverished set
      of string-processing utilities, which is a problem for authors of
      portable code. This <abbr title="Scheme Request for Implementation">SRFI</abbr> proposes a coherent and
      comprehensive set of string-processing procedures; it is accompanied by a
      reference implementation of the spec. The reference implementation
      is
      <ul>
        <li>portable
        <li>efficient
        <li>open source
      </ul>
      <p>The routines in this SRFI are
      backwards-compatible with the string-processing routines of <abbr title="Revised^5 Report on Scheme">R5RS</abbr>.
