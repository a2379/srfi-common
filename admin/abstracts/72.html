      <p>This SRFI describes a procedural macro proposal
      for Scheme with the following features:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Improved hygiene:</h3>
          <p>We argue that conventional hygiene
          algorithms may lead to accidental variable capture errors in
          procedural macros. We propose an improved algorithm that avoids these
          problems.
        <li>
          <h3>Reflective tower:</h3>
          <p>We specify a reflective tower of arbitrary
          height, and propose a refinement of lexical scoping that takes into
          account the phase of use of an identifier in determining its
          meaning.
        <li>
          <h3>Syntax-case:</h3>
          <p>In the current proposal, the
          <tt>syntax-case</tt> form is expressible as a macro in terms of a
          simpler set of primitives and is specified as library syntax.
        <li>
          <h3>Procedural interface:</h3>
          <p>The primitive interface for manipulating
          compound syntax objects consists of procedures rather than special
          forms. In particular, the traditional abstractions <tt>car</tt>,
          <tt>cdr</tt>, <tt>cons</tt> , <tt>...</tt> can be used on syntactic
          data.
        <li>
          <h3>Fast hygiene algorithm:</h3>
          <p>The reference implementation documents a
          fast imperative hygiene algorithm that is eager and linear in
          expression size.
        <li>
          <h3>Capturing identifiers:</h3>
          <p>A primitive
          <tt>make-capturing-identifier</tt> is provided for intentional
          variable capture and for building expansion-time fluid binding
          constructs.
      </ul>
