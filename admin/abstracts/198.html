<p>
When P<small>OSIX</small> system calls are mapped to Scheme exceptions,
this small SRFI provides the means to construct, signal, and extract
information from those signals in a reasonably uniform way.
They are in their own SRFI in order to avoid being tied to any
single P<small>OSIX</small>-based SRFI such as SRFI 170.
