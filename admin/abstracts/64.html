      <p>This defines an API for writing <dfn>test
      suites</dfn>, to make it easy to portably test Scheme APIs, libraries,
      applications, and implementations. A test suite is a collection of
      <dfn>test cases</dfn> that execute in the context of a
      <dfn>test-runner</dfn>. This specifications also supports writing new

      result of running test suites.
