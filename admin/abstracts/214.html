<p>A <em>flexvector</em>, also known as a dynamic array or an arraylist, is a mutable vector-like data structure with an adjustable size. Flexvectors allow fast random access and fast insertion/removal at the end. This SRFI defines a suite of operations on flexvectors, modeled after <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-133/srfi-133.html">SRFI 133</a>'s vector operations.</p>
