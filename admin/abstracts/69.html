      <p>This SRFI defines basic hash tables. Hash
      tables are widely recognised as a fundamental data structure for a wide
      variety of applications. A hash table is a data structure that:
      <ol>
        <li>provides a mapping from some set of keys to
        some set of values associated to those keys
        <li>has no intrinsic order for the (key, value)
        associations it contains
        <li>supports in-place modification as the
        primary means of setting the contents of a hash table
        <li>provides key lookup and destructive update
        in amortised constant time, provided that a good hash function is
        used.
      </ol>
      <p>This SRFI aims to accomplish these
      goals:
      <ol>
        <li>to provide a consistent, generic and widely
        applicable API for hash tables
        <li>to improve code portability by providing a
        standard hash table facility with guaranteed behaviour
        <li>to help the programmer by defining utility
        routines that account for the most common situations of using hash
        tables.
      </ol>
