<p>An INI file is a configuration file that consists of key-value
pairs for properties, and sections that group the properties. The
name of these configuration files comes from the filename extension
<code>INI</code>, short for initialization.
The format has become an informal standard in many contexts of configuration.
This SRFI provides access to the contents of an INI file.
