    <p>The record mechanism of R<sup>6</sup>RS is refined.  In
      particular, the triad of record names, record-type descriptors
      and record constructor descriptors can be effectively ignored
      and replaced with the single notion of a record descriptor.  It
      also removes the restriction that the syntactic layer can only
      define one constructor per record type defined.</p>
