<p>Many Scheme implementations have keyword arguments but they have
not been widely standardized. This SRFI defines the macros
<code>keyword-lambda</code> and <code>keyword-call</code>. They can be
used identically in every major implementation currently in use,
making it safe to use keyword arguments in portable code.  The macros
expand to native keyword arguments in Schemes that have them, letting
programmers mix portable code and implementation-specific code.</p>
