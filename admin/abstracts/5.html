      <p>The <i>named-let</i> incarnation of the
      <code>let</code> form has two slight inconsistencies with the
      <code>define</code> form. As defined, the <code>let</code> form makes no
      accommodation for rest arguments, an issue of functionality and
      consistency. As defined, the <code>let</code> form does not accommodate
      signature-style syntax, an issue of aesthetics and consistency. Both
      issues are addressed here in a manner which is compatible with the
      traditional <code>let</code> form but for minor extensions.
