      <p>This SRFI describes how to modify the
      <i>Revised Report</i> (<a href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/">R5RS</a>) in order to
      enable conforming implementations to use an extended character set such
      as (but not limited to) <a href="http://www.unicode.org">Unicode</a>.
      <p>Changes to some requirements of the report are
      recommended. Currently, the <i>Revised Report</i> contains requirements
      which are difficult or impossible to satisfy with some extended character
      sets.
      <p>New required procedures are proposed,
      specified, and included in the reference implementation. These procedures
      enable portable Scheme programs to manipulate Scheme source texts and
      source data accurately, even in implementations using extended character
      sets.
      <p>This SRFI concludes with some suggestions for
      implementors interested in providing good Unicode support, using these
      suggestions to illustrate how the proposed changes to the <i>Revised
      Report</i> can "play out" in Unicode-based Scheme.
      <p>This SRFI does <b>not</b> attempt to provide a
      comprehensive library for global text processing. For example, one issue
      in global text processing is the need for linguistically-sensitive,
      locale-sensitive procedures for sorting strings. Such procedures are
      beyond the scope of this SRFI. On the other hand, by making Scheme
      compatible with extended character sets, this SRFI is a step in the
      direction of permitting global text processing standard libraries to be
      developed in a form portable across all conforming
      implementations.
      <p>This SRFI does <b>not</b> propose that
      implementations be required to support Unicode or any other extended
      character set. It does not specify a representation for Unicode
      characters or strings. It <b>does</b> revise the specifications of the
      report so that <code>char?</code> values <i>may be</i> Unicode (or other)
      characters.
      <p>The reference implementation included should
      prove to be easily ported to and effective for all ASCII-only
      implementations and for many implementations using an 8-bit character set
      which is an extension of ASCII (it will require very minor modifications
      for each particular implementation). Other implementations may need to
      use a different implementation.
