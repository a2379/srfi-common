      <p>This SRFI proposes a coherent and comprehensive
      set of procedures for manipulating lists as sets; it is accompanied by a
      reference implementation of the spec. The reference implementation
      is
      <ul>
        <li>portable
        <li>efficient
        <li>completely open, public-domain source
      </ul>
      <p>Be aware that these procedures are inherently
      O(n^2) in the lengths of their parameter lists - serious set operations
      on large lists should use alternate techniques.
