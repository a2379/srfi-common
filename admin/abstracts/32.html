      <p>Current Scheme sorting packages are, every one
      of them, surprisingly bad. I've designed the API for a full-featured sort
      toolkit, which I propose as an SRFI. The spec comes with 1200 lines of
      high-quality reference code: tightly written, highly commented, portable
      code, available for free. Implementors want this code. It's better than
      what you have.
