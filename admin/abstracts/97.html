      <p>Over the past ten years, numerous libraries
      have been specified via the Scheme Requests for Implementation process.
      Yet until the recent ratification of the Revised<sup>6</sup> Report on
      the Algorithmic Language Scheme, there has been no standardized way of
      distributing or relying upon library code. Now that such a library system
      exists, there is a real need to organize these existing SRFI libraries so
      that they can be portably referenced.
      <p>This SRFI is designed to facilitate the writing
      and distribution of code that relies on SRFI libraries. It identifies a
      subset of existing SRFIs that specify features amenable to provision (and
      possibly implementation) as libraries (SRFI Libraries) and proposes a
      naming convention for this subset so that these libraries may be referred
      to by name or by number. <!--
This convention represents a consensus among current R<sup>6</sup>RS
implementors.
