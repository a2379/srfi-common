<p>This SRFI contains various procedures that accept and return procedures,
as well as a few others, drawn from
<a href="https://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/combinators">an earlier version of Chicken</a>.
Common Lisp has a few of them too, and more come from
<a href="https://programmingpraxis.com/contents/standard-prelude/">the Standard Prelude from <em>Programming Praxis</em></a>.
Using these procedures helps to keep code terse
and reduce the need for ad hoc lambdas.</p>
