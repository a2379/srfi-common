      <p>This SRFI defines exception-handling and
      exception-raising constructs for Scheme, including
      <ul>
        <li>a <code>with-exception-handler</code>
        procedure and a <code>guard</code> form for installing
        exception-handling procedures,
        <li>a <code>raise</code> procedure for invoking
        the current exception handler.
      </ul>
      <p>This SRFI is based on (withdrawn) <a href=
      "/srfi-12/">SRFI 12: Exception Handling</a> by William Clinger, R. Kent
      Dybvig, Matthew Flatt, and Marc Feeley.
