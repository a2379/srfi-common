<p>Scheme lacks a flexible way to create and apply curried procedures.
This SRFI describes <code>lambda*</code>, a variant of
<code>lambda</code> that creates true curried procedures which also
behave just like ordinary Scheme procedures.  They can be applied to
their arguments one-by-one, all at once, or anywhere in between,
without any novel syntax.  <code>lambda*</code> also supports nullary
and variadic procedures, and procedures created with it have
predictable behavior when applied to surplus arguments.</p>
