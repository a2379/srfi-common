<p>This SRFI defines utility procedures that create, transform, and consume generators.
  A generator is simply a procedure with no arguments that works
  as a source of values.  Every time it is called,
  it yields a value.  Generators may be finite or infinite; a finite
  generator returns an end-of-file object to indicate that it is exhausted.
  For example, <code>read-char</code>, <code>read-line</code>,
  and <code>read</code> are generators that
  generate characters, lines, and objects from the current input port.
  Generators provide lightweight laziness.

<p>This SRFI also defines procedures that return accumulators.
  An accumulator is the inverse of a generator:  it is a procedure of one argument
  that works as a sink of values.
