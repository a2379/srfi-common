      <p>This attempts to solve the same issues with
      R7RS strings raised by <a href="/srfi-135/">SRFI-135</a>, but with better
      integration with the Scheme language.
      <p>We propose to retain the name <dfn>string</dfn>
      as the type of sequences of Unicode characters (scalar values). There are
      two standard subtypes of string:
      <ul>
        <li>Immutable strings, also called
        <dfn>istrings</dfn>, cannot be modified after they have been created.
        Calling <code>string-set!</code> on an istring throws an error. On the
        other hand, the core operations <code>string-ref</code> and
        <code>string-length</code> are guaranteed to be O(1).
        <li>Mutable strings can be modified
        <q>in-place</q> using <code>string-set!</code> and other operations.
        However, <code>string-ref</code>, <code>string-set!</code>, or
        <code>string-length</code> have no performance guarantees. On many
        implementation they may take time proportional to the length of the
        string.
      </ul>
      <p>An implementation may support other kinds of
      strings. For example on the Java platform it may be reasonable to
      consider any instance of <code>java.lang.CharSequence</code> to be a
      string.
      <p>The main part of the proposal specifies the
      default bindings of various procedure names, as might be pre-defined in a
      REPL. Specifically, some procedures that traditionally return mutable
      strings are changed to return istrings. We later discuss compatibility
      and other library issues.
      <p>This combines <a href="/srfi-13/">SRFI-13</a>,
      <a href="/srfi-135/">SRFI-135</a>, and <a href=
      "srfi-118/">SRFI-118</a>.
