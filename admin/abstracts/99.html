      <p>Many Scheme programmers have considered records
      to be one of the most important features missing from the R5RS. The R6RS
      proposed a record system, but its design has been widely criticized and
      it was not intended for use in R5RS programs anyway.
      <p>This SRFI proposes a better record system for
      use in R5RS, ERR5RS, and R6RS programs. The syntactic layer of this
      SRFI's record system is an extension of SRFI 9. The procedural and
      inspection layers of this SRFI's record system are perfectly compatible
      with its syntactic layer. This entire SRFI is compatible with the
      procedural and inspection layers of the R6RS record system, but offers
      several worthwhile improvements over the R6RS system.
