      <p>Lisp-based languages, like Scheme, are almost
      the only programming languages in modern use that do not support infix
      notation. In addition, most languages allow infix expressions to be
      combined with function call notation of the form
      <code><var>f</var>(<var>x</var>)</code>. This SRFI provides these
      capabilities, both for developers who already use Scheme and want these
      conveniences, and also for other developers who may choose to use other
      languages in part because they miss these conveniences. Scheme currently
      reserves <code>{</code>...<code>}</code> “for possible future extensions
      to the language”. We propose that <code>{</code>...<code>}</code> be used
      to support “curly-infix-expression” notation as a homoiconic infix
      abbreviation, as a modification of the Scheme reader. It is an
      abbreviation in much the same way that <samp>'x</samp> is an abbreviation
      for <samp>(quote&nbsp;x)</samp>.
      <p>A <dfn>curly-infix list</dfn> introduces a list
      whose visual presentation can be in infix order instead of prefix order.
      For example, <samp>{n&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;5}</samp> ⇒
      <samp>(&gt;&nbsp;n&nbsp;5)</samp>, and
      <samp>{a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b&nbsp;+&nbsp;c}</samp> ⇒
      <samp>(+&nbsp;a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c)</samp>. By intent, there is no precedence,
      but e.g., <samp>{x&nbsp;+&nbsp;{y&nbsp;*&nbsp;z}}</samp> maps cleanly to
      <samp>(+&nbsp;x&nbsp;(*&nbsp;y&nbsp;z))</samp>. Forms with mixed infix
      operators and other complications have “<code>$nfx$</code>” prepended to
      enable later processing, e.g.,
      <samp>{4&nbsp;+&nbsp;5&nbsp;*&nbsp;6}</samp> ⇒
      <samp>($nfx$&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;5&nbsp;*&nbsp;6)</samp>. Also, inside a
      curly-infix list (recursively), expressions of the form
      <code><var>f</var>(</code>...<code>)</code> are simply an abbreviation
      for <code>(<var>f</var>&nbsp;</code>...<code>)</code>.
      <p>Note that this is derived from the “<a href="http://readable.sourceforge.net/">readable</a>” project. We intend to
      later submit at least one additional SRFI that will build on top of this
      SRFI, but curly-infix-expressions are useful on their own.
