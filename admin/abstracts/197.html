<p>Many functional languages provide pipeline operators, like Clojure's <code>-&gt;</code> or OCaml's <code>|&gt;</code>. Pipelines are a simple, terse, and readable way to write deeply-nested expressions. This SRFI defines a family of <code>chain</code> and <code>nest</code> pipeline operators, which can rewrite nested expressions like <code>(a b (c d (e f g)))</code> as a sequence of operations: <code>(chain g (e f _) (c d _) (a b _))</code>.</p>
