<p>Threading macros provide a simple, readable way to write deeply-nested expressions. Also known as "arrows", these macros were first introduced in Clojure, and are a key feature of that language. With threading macros, expressions like <code>(append (cons (assoc x y) c) '(a b))</code> can be written as a sequence of operations: <code>(-&gt; x (assoc y) (cons c) (append '(a b))</code>.</p>
