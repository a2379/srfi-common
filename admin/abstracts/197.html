<p>Many functional languages provide chaining or pipeline operators, like Clojure's <code>-&gt;</code> or OCaml's <code>|&gt;</code>. Chaining is a simple, terse, and readable way to write deeply nested expressions. This SRFI defines a family of <code>chain</code> operators, which can rewrite nested expressions like <code>(a b (c d (e f g)))</code> as a sequence of operations: <code>(chain g (e f) (c d) (a b))</code>.</p>
