      <p>The SRFI defines exception-handling constructs
      for Scheme, including
      <ul>
        <li>the CURRENT-EXCEPTION-HANDLER procedure for
        obtaining the current exception-handling procedure,
        <li>the WITH-EXCEPTION-HANDLER procedure and
        HANDLE-EXCEPTIONS form for installing an exception-handling
        procedure,
        <li>the ABORT and SIGNAL procedures for raising
        exceptions, and
        <li>constructs for creating and inspecting
        <em>condition</em> values, which encapsulate information about an
        exception.
      </ul>
      <p>This SRFI requires a Scheme implementation to
      raise an exception whenever an error is to be signaled or whenever the
      system determines that evaluation cannot proceed in a manner consistent
      with the semantics of Scheme. However, this SRFI does not define the
      information to be supplied by an implementation for each possible kind of
      exception; such a specification is left open for future SRFIs.
