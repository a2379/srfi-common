      <p><a href="/srfi-47/">SRFI-47</a> and its
      successor <a href="/srfi-63/">SRFI-63</a> provide both homogeneous numeric
      and heterogeneous multidimensional arrays which subsume Scheme vectors.
      The notation presented here builds upon Common-Lisp array syntax to
      represent heterogeneous arrays; and introduces a new Scheme-based
      notation for denoting homogeneous numeric arrays.
