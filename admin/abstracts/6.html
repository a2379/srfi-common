      <p>Scheme's i/o primitives are extended by adding
      three new procedures that
      <ul>
        <li>create an input port from a string,
        <li>create an output port whose contents are
        accumulated in Scheme's working memory instead of an external file,
        and
        <li>extract the accumulated contents of an
        in-memory output port and return them in the form of a string.
      </ul>
