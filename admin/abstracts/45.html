      <p>Lazy evaluation is traditionally simulated in
      Scheme using <code>delay</code> and <code>force</code>. However, these
      primitives are not powerful enough to express a large class of lazy
      algorithms that are iterative. Indeed, it is folklore in the Scheme
      community that typical iterative lazy algorithms written using
      <code>delay</code> and <code>force</code> will often require unbounded
      memory.
      <p>Although varous modifications of
      <code>delay</code> and <code>force</code> had been proposed to resolve
      this problem (see e.g., the SRFI-40 discussion list) they all fail some
      of the benchmarks provided below. To our knowledge, the current SRFI
      provides the first exhaustive solution to this problem.
      <p>As motivation, we first explain how the usual
      laziness encoding using only <code>delay</code> and <code>force</code>
      will break the iterative behavior of typical algorithms that would have
      been properly tail-recursive in a true lazy language, causing the
      computation to require unbounded memory.
      <p>The problem is then resolved by introducing a
      set of three operations:
      <pre>
    {<code>lazy</code>, <code>delay</code>, <code>force</code>}
</pre>which allow the programmer to succinctly
express lazy algorithms while retaining bounded space behavior in cases that
are properly tail-recursive. A general recipe for using these primitives is
provided. An additional procedure <code>{eager}</code> is provided for the
construction of eager promises in cases where efficiency is a concern.<br>

      <br>
      <p>Although this SRFI redefines <code>delay</code>
      and <code>force</code>, the extension is conservative in the sense that
      the semantics of the subset {<code>delay</code>, <code>force</code>} in
      isolation (i.e., as long as the program does not use <code>lazy</code>)
      agrees with that in R5RS. In other words, no program that uses the R5RS
      definitions of delay and force will break if those definition are
      replaced by the SRFI-45 definitions of delay and force.
