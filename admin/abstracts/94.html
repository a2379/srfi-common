      <p>In the coding of numerial calculations in
      latent-typed languages it is good practice to assure that those
      calculations are using the intended number system. The most common number
      systems for programmatic calculations are the integers, reals, and
      complexes. This SRFI introduces 14 real-only and 3 integer-only variants
      of R5RS procedures to facilitate numerical type checking and
      declaration.
