      <p>This SRFI introduces the
      <code>rest-values</code> procedure which has three modes of
      operation:
      <ol>
        <li>it processes a rest list after checking its
        elements with default values or predicate procedures,
        <li>it processes a rest list with default values
        without checking its elements,
        <li>it processes a default list whose elements
        are lists or pairs, after checking their elements that are default
        values or predicate procedures with the elements of a rest list,
      </ol>
      <p>and eight macros which additionally check the
      rest arguments that are returned by <code>rest-values</code>.
