      <p>This document specifies Format Strings, a
      method of interpreting a Scheme string which contains a number of format
      directives that are replaced with other string data according to the
      semantics of each directive. This SRFI extends <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-28">SRFI-28</a> in being more generally useful but is less general
      than advanced format strings in that it does not allow, aside from ~F,
      for controlled positioning of text within fields.
