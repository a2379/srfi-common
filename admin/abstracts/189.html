<p>This SRFI defines two disjoint immutable container types
known as Maybe and Either,
both of which can contain objects collectively known as their payload.
A Maybe object is either a Just object or the unique object Nothing
(which has no payload); an Either object is either
a Right object or a Left object.  Maybe represents the concept of an
optional value; Either represents the concept of a value which is
either correct (Right) or an error (Left).</p>
<p>Note that the terms Maybe, Just, Nothing, Either, Right, and Left
are capitalized in this SRFI so as not to be confused with their
ordinary use as English words.  Thus &quot;returns Nothing&quot; means
&quot;returns the unique Nothing object&quot;; &quot;returns nothing&quot; could be
interpreted as &quot;returns no values&quot;.</p>
