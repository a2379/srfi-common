<p>Scheme has the notion of the <em>dynamic extent</em> of a
  procedure call.  A number of standard Scheme procedures and
  syntaxes
  like <code>dynamic-wind</code>, <code>call-with-current-continuation</code>,
  and <code>parameterize</code>
  deal with the dynamic extent indirectly.  The same holds true
  for the procedures and syntaxes dealing with continuation
  marks as defined by <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-157/srfi-157.html">SRFI
  157</a>.</p>

<p>This SRFI reifies the dynamic extent into a first-class value
  together with a well-defined procedural interface and a syntax to
  create procedures that remember not only their environment at
  creation time but also their dynamic extent, which includes their
  dynamic environment.</p>
