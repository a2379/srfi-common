	<p>Scheme has the notion of the <em>dynamic extent</em> of a
	procedure call.  A number of standard Scheme procedures and
	syntaxes
	like <code>dynamic-wind</code>, <code>call-with-current-continuation</code>,
	and <code>parameterize</code>
	deal with the dynamic extent indirectly.

	<p>This SRFI reifies the dynamic extent into a first-class value
	together with a well-defined procedural interface and a syntax to
	create procedures that remember not only their environment at
	creation time but also their dynamic extent, which includes their
	dynamic environment.
