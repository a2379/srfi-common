<p>Many people find that large numbers are easier to read when the
  digits are broken into small groups.  For example, the number
  <code>1582439</code> might be easier to read if written as <code>1
  582 439</code>.  This applies to source code as it does to other
  writing.  We propose an extension of Scheme syntax to allow the
  underscore as a digit separator in numerical constants.</p>
