<p>Many people find that large numbers are easier to read when the
  digits are broken into small groups.  For example the number
  `1582439` might be easier to read if written as `1 582 439`.  This
  applies to source code as it does to other writing.  We propose an
  extension of Scheme syntax to allow the underscore as a digit
  separator in numerical constants.</p>
