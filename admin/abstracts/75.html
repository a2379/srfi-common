      <p>Unicode is a widespread universal character
      code that supports most of the world's (natural) languages. The
      extensions to Scheme specified in this SRFI concern the support of
      Unicode in Scheme's character, string, and symbol datatypes. This SRFI
      does not (fully) specify how I/O of Unicode data is performed or how
      Scheme source code is encoded in files; these aspects are left for other
      SRFIs to specify.
