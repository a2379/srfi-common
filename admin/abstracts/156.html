<p>Recognizing binary predicates as a specific area
  in which the use of prefix operators is an impediment,
  we propose a thin layer of "syntactic stevia" for in-fixing
  such predicates. It can be implemented using regular Scheme
  macros. We suggest that the code <code>(is x &lt; y)</code> should
  be transformed to <code>(&lt; x y)</code>, and <code>(is x &lt; y &lt;= z)</code>
  -- to <code>(let ((y* y)) (and (&lt; x y*) (&lt;= y* z)))</code>.
  In addition, we suggest special meaning to the <code>_</code> symbol:
  <code>(is _ &lt; y)</code> and <code>(is x &lt; _)</code>
  should be transformed to <code>(lambda (_) (&lt; _ y))</code>
  and <code>(lambda (_) (&lt x _))</code>, respectively.
  This SRFI document also describes some other uses of the
  <code>is</code> macro and its limitations.</p>
