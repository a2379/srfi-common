      <p>This SRFI defines utility procedures that
      create, transform, and consume generators. A generator is simply a
      procedure with no arguments that works as a source of a series of values.
      Every time it is called, it yields a value. Generators may be finite or
      infinite; a finite generator returns an end-of-file object to indicate
      that it is exhausted. For example, <code>read-char</code>,
      <code>read-line</code>, and <code>read</code> are generators that
      generate characters, lines, and objects from the current input port.
      Generators provide lightweight laziness.
