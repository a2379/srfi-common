      <p>This SRFI describes a configuration language to
      be used for specifing the set of Scheme features or extensions required
      to run a program. In addition to a list of required features, a program
      may also contain Scheme code to be used only when a particular feature or
      combination of features is available.
      <p>The configuration language is entirely distinct
      from Scheme; it is neither embedded in Scheme nor includes Scheme as a
      subset.
