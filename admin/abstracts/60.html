      <p>Treating integers as two's-complement strings
      of bits is an arcane but important domain of computer science. It is used
      for:
      <ul>
        <li>hashing;
        <li>Galois-field[2] calculations of
        error-detecting and error-correcting codes;
        <li>cryptography and ciphers;
        <li>pseudo-random number generation;
        <li>register-transfer-level modeling of digital
        logic designs;
        <li>Fast-Fourier transforms;
        <li>packing and unpacking numbers in persistant
        data structures;
        <li>space-filling curves with applications to
        dimension reduction and sparse multi-dimensional database indexes;
        and
        <li>generating approximate seed values for
        root-finders and transcendental function algorithms.
      </ul>
