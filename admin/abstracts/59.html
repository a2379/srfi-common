      <p>A vicinity is a descriptor for a place in the
      file system. Vicinities hide from the programmer the concepts of host,
      volume, directory, and version. Vicinities express only the concept of a
      file environment where a file name can be resolved to a file in a system
      independent manner.
      <p>All of these procedures are file-system
      dependent. Use of these vicinity procedures can make programs file-system
      <em>in</em>dependent.
