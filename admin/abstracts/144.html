      <p>This SRFI describes numeric procedures
      applicable to <em>flonums</em>, a subset of the inexact real numbers
      provided by a Scheme implementation. In most Schemes, the flonums and the
      inexact reals are the same. These procedures are semantically equivalent
      to the corresponding generic procedures, but allow more efficient
      implementations.
