      <p><abbr title=
      "Revised&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Report on Scheme">R5RS</abbr> Scheme has
      an impoverished set of string-processing utilities, which is a problem
      for authors of portable code. Although <abbr title=
      "Revised&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Report on Scheme">R7RS</abbr> provides
      some extensions and improvements, it is still very incomplete. This
      <abbr title="Scheme Request for Implementation">SRFI</abbr> proposes a
      coherent and comprehensive set of string-processing procedures; it is
      accompanied by a portable sample implementation of the spec.
      <p>This SRFI is derived from SRFI 13. The biggest
      difference is that it allows subsequences of strings to be specified by
      <em>cursors</em> as well as the traditional string indexes. In addition,
      it omits the comparison, case-mapping, and mutation operations of SRFI
      13, as well as all procedures already present in <abbr title=
      "Revised&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Report on Scheme">R7RS</abbr>.
