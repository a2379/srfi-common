      <p>Many Scheme implementations support exact
      arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic as well as exact rational number
      computation. This SRFI extends the rational numbers of R5RS by adding two
      rational infinities (1/0, -1/0).
      <p>With infinities added to the number system we
      find that division by zero "works". It lets initialization of variables
      precede bounds checks and gives flexibility in placement of those
      checks.
