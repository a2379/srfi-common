      <p>This SRFI defines an I/O layer for lazy, mostly
      functional buffered streams.
      <p>The layer architecture is similar to the upper
      three layers of the I/O subsystem in <a href=
      "http://www.standardml.org/Basis/">The Standard ML Basis
      Library</a>.
      <p>In particular, this layer provides
      <ul>
        <li>buffered reading and writing
        <li>arbitrary lookahead
        <li>dynamic redirection of input or
        output
        <li>binary and text I/O, mixed if needed
        <li>translated data streams
        <li>the ability to create I/O streams from
        arbitrary readers and writers
      </ul>
      <p>It builds on the Primitive I/O layer specified
      in <a href="/srfi-79/">SRFI 79 (Primitive I/O)</a>.
