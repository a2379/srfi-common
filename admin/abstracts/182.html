<p>Unlike the VALUES and CALL-WITH-VALUES mechanism of R5RS, this one
uses an explicit representation for multiple return values as a single
value, namely a procedure.  Decomposition of multiple values is done
by simple application.  The macro, ADBMAL, evaluates to a procedure
that takes one procedure argument.  The ADBMAL macro can be compared
with LAMBDA.  While a LAMBDA expression that consists of
&lt;formals&gt; and &lt;body&gt; requires some actual arguments later
when the evaluated LAMBDA expression is called, an ADBMAL expression
that consists of &lt;expression&gt;s corresponding to actual arguments
of LAMBDA requires &lt;formals&gt; and &lt;body&gt;, that is, an
evaluated LAMBDA expression, later when the evaluated ADBMAL
expression is called.</p>

<p>This SRFI also introduces the new LET-syntax ALET and ALET*, which
depend on ADBMAL to manipulate multiple values, and which are
compatible with LET and LET* of R5RS in single-value bindings.  They
also have a binding form making use of VALUES and CALL-WITH-VALUES to
handle multiple values, and new binding forms for list, cons, and
other multiple values.  In addition, they have several new binding
forms for useful functions such as escape, iteration, optional
arguments, etc.</p>
