<p>This is an extract from the R6RS that documents its support for
transcoders and transcoded ports.  These provide a hook into the
Scheme port system from below, allowing the creation of textual ports
that provide non-default encoding and decoding from arbitrary binary
ports.  It has been lightly edited to fit R7RS style.</p>
