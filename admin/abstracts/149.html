      <p>The rules for valid
      <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>s of <code>&lt;syntax rules&gt;</code> are
      slightly softened to allow for more than one consecutive
      <code>&lt;ellipsis&gt;</code> in subtemplates, and to allow pattern
      variables in subtemplates to be followed by more instances of the
      identifier <code>&lt;ellipsis&gt;</code> than they are followed in the
      subpattern in which they occur.
