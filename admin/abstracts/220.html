  <p>Many language-agnostic programming tools rely on specially
  formatted source code comments to annotate the code with
  metadata. Such "magic comments" are hard for both humans and
  computers to parse reliably, as the purpose of a comment is to be
  free-form text that is not interpreted by machine.</p>
  <p>This SRFI extends the standard Scheme directive syntax
  (<code>#!</code>) to support <em>line directives</em>. They look
  like magic comments to language-agnostic tools but read as
  S-expressions in Scheme, combining the portability of magic
  comments with the well-defined syntax and easy parsing of
  ordinary Scheme code.</p>
