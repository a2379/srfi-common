<p>Compound objects are analogous to R6RS compound conditions,
and are suitable for use in creating and handling conditions
on non-R6RS systems, among other purposes.
They encapsulate an immutable sequence of subobjects, which can be
any object except another compound object.
It is possible to implement R6RS compound conditions on top of
compound objects, but not vice versa.
Note that this SRFI does not provide any analogue to R6RS
<i>simple</i> conditions, which are just records.
