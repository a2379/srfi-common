      <p>This SRFI proposes
      <tt>(write-with-shared-structure)</tt> and
      <tt>(read-with-shared-structure)</tt>, procedures for writing and reading
      external representations of data containing shared structure. These
      procedures implement a proposed standard external notation for data
      containing shared structure.
      <p>This SRFI permits but does not require
      replacing the standard <tt>(write)</tt> and <tt>(read)</tt> functions.
      These functions may be implemented without the overhead in time and space
      required to detect and specify shared structure.
      <p>An implementation conforms to this SRFI if it
      provides procedures named <tt>(write-with-shared-structure)</tt> and
      <tt>(read-with-shared-structure)</tt>, which produce and read the same
      notation as produced by the reference implementation. It may also provide
      <tt>(read/ss)</tt> and <tt>(write/ss)</tt>, equivalent functions with
      shorter names.
