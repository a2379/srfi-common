      <p>This SRFI introduces a macro,
      DEFINE-LAMBDA-OBJECT which defines a set of procedures, that is, a group,
      two constructors, and a predicate. The constructors also make a group of
      procedures, namely lambda objects. The macro extends DEFINE-RECORD-TYPE
      (SRFI 9) in being more general but much less general than DEFCLASS
      (CLOS). The macro has no explicit field accessors and mutators but parent
      groups, required fields, optional fields, automatic fields, read-write
      fields, read-only fields, inaccessible hidden fields, immutable virtual
      fields, and common sharing fields.
