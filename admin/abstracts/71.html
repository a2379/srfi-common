      <p>This SRFI is a proposal for extending
      <code>let</code>, <code>let*</code>, and <code>letrec</code> for
      receiving multiple values. The syntactic extension is fully compatible
      with the existing syntax. It is the intention that single-value bindings,
      i.e. <code>(let ((var expr)) ...)</code>, and multiple-value binding can
      be mixed freely and conveniently.
      <p>The most simple form of the new syntax is best
      explained by an example:
      <pre>
(define (quo-rem x y)
  (values (quotient x y) (remainder x y)))

(define (quo x y)
  (let ((q r (quo-rem x y)))
    q))
</pre>
      <p>The procedure <code>quo-rem</code> delivers two
      values to its continuation. These values are received as <code>q</code>
      and <code>r</code> in the <code>let</code>-expression of the procedure
      <code>quo</code>. In other words, the syntax of <code>let</code> is
      extended such that several variables can be specified---and these
      variables receive the values delivered by the expression <code>(quo-rem x
      y)</code>.
      <p>The syntax of <code>let</code> is further
      extended to cases in which a rest argument receives the list of all
      residual values. Again by example,
      <pre>
(let (((values y1 y2 . y3+) (foo x)))
   body)
</pre>In this example, <code>values</code> is a
syntactic keyword indicating the presence of multiple values to be received,
and <code>y1</code>, <code>y2</code>, and <code>y3+</code>, resp., are
variables bound to the first value, the second value, and the list of the
remaining values, resp., as produced by <code>(foo x)</code>. The syntactic
keyword <code>values</code> allows receiving all values as in <code>(let
(((values . xs) (foo x))) body)</code>. It also allows receiving no values at
all as in <code>(let (((values) (for-each foo list))) body)</code>.<br>
      <br>
      <p>A common application of binding multiple values
      is decomposing data structures into their components. This mechanism is
      illustrated in its most primitive form as follows: The procedure
      <code>uncons</code> (defined below) decomposes a pair <code>x</code> into
      its car and its cdr and delivers them as two values to its continuation.
      Then an extended <code>let</code> can receive these values:
      <pre>
(let ((car-x cdr-x (uncons x)))
  (foo car-x cdr-x))
</pre>
      <p>Of course, for pairs this method is probably
      neither faster nor clearer than using the procedures <code>car</code> and
      <code>cdr</code>. However, for data structures doing substantial work
      upon decomposition this is different: Extracting the element of highest
      priority from a priority queue, while at the same time constructing the
      residual queue, can both be more efficient and more convenient than doing
      both operations independently. In fact, the <code>quo-rem</code> example
      illustrates this point already as both quotient and remainder are
      probably computed by a common exact division algorithm. (And often
      caching is used to avoid executing this algorithm twice as often as
      needed.)
      <p>As the last feature of this SRFI, a mechanism
      is specified to store multiple values in heap-allocated data structures.
      For this purpose, <code>values-&gt;list</code> and
      <code>values-&gt;vector</code> construct a list (a vector, resp.) storing
      all values delivered by evaluating their argument expression. Note that
      these operations cannot be procedures.
