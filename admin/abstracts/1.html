      <p><abbr title="Revised^5 Report on Scheme">R5RS</abbr> Scheme has an impoverished set
      of list-processing utilities, which is a problem for authors of portable
      code. This <abbr title="Scheme Request for Implementation">SRFI</abbr>
      proposes a coherent and comprehensive set of list-processing procedures;
      it is accompanied by a reference implementation of the spec. The
      reference implementation is
      <ul>
        <li>portable
        <li>efficient
        <li>completely open, public-domain source
      </ul>
