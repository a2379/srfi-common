      <p>An ephemeron is an object with two components
      called its <em>key</em> and its <em>datum</em>. It differs from an
      ordinary pair as follows: if the garbage collector (GC) can prove that
      there are no references to the key except from the ephemeron itself and
      possibly from the datum, then it is free to <em>break</em> the ephemeron,
      dropping its reference to both key and datum. In other words, an
      ephemeron can be broken when nobody else cares about its key. Ephemerons
      can be used to construct weak vectors or lists and (possibly in
      combination with finalizers) weak hash tables.
      <p>Much of this specification is derived with
      thanks from the MIT Scheme Reference Manual.
