      <p><span class="c1">Streams, sometimes called
      lazy lists, are a sequential data structure containing elements computed
      only on demand. A stream is either null or is a pair with a stream in its
      cdr. Since elements of a stream are computed only when accessed, streams
      can be infinite. Once computed, the value of a stream element is cached
      in case it is needed again.</span>
      <p><span class="c1">Streams without memoization
      were first described by Peter Landin in 1965. Memoization became accepted
      as an essential feature of streams about a decade later. Today, streams
      are the signature data type of functional programming languages such as
      Haskell.</span>
      <p><span class="c1">This Scheme Request for
      Implementation describes two libraries for operating on streams: a
      canonical set of stream primitives and a set of procedures and syntax
      derived from those primitives that permits convenient expression of
      stream operations. They rely on facilities provided by R6RS, including
      libraries, records, and error reporting. To load both stream libraries,
