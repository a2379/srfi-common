      <p>This SRFI defines a set of procedures for
      creating, accessing, and manipulating octet-addressed blocks of binary
      data, in short, <i>blobs</i>. The SRFI provides access primitives for
      fixed-length integers of arbitrary size, with specified endianness, and a
      choice of unsigned and two's complement representations.
