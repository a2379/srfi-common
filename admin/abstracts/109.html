      <p>This specifies a reader extension for extended
      string quasi-literals, including nicer multi-line strings, and enclosed
      unquoted expressions.
      <p>This proposal is related to <a href=
      "/srfi-108/">SRFI-108 (named quasi-literal constructors)</a> and <a href=
      "/srfi-107/">SRFI-107 (XML reader syntax)</a>, as they share quite a bit
      of syntax.
