      <p>This SRFI proposes a simple extension to
      Scheme's lexical syntax that allows individual S-expressions to be made
      into comments, ignored by the reader. This contrasts with the standard
      Lisp semicolon commnets, which make the reader ignore the remainder of
      the line, and the slightly less common block comments, as <a href="">SRFI
      30</a> defines: both of these mechanisms comment out slices of text, not
      S-expressions.
