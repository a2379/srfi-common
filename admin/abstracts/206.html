This SRFI defines a mechanism for defining auxiliary syntax
keywords independently in different modules in such a way that
they still have the same binding so that they can be used
interchangeably as literal identifiers in
<code>syntax-rules</code> and <code>syntax-case</code> expressions
and can be both imported under the same name without conflicts.
