      <p>We propose the implementation of a special form
      called <code>rec</code>. This form is a generalization and combination of
      the forms <code>rec</code> and <code>named-lambda</code> of
      [Clinger1985]. It allows the simple and non-imperative construction of
      self-referential expressions. As an important special case, it extends
      the A. Church form <code>lambda</code> such that it allows the direct
      definition of recursive procedures without using further special forms
      like <code>let</code> or <code>letrec</code>, without using advanced
      constructions like the H. B. Curry combinator and, unlike
      <code>define</code>, without introducing variable bindings into the
      external environment.
