      <p>This SRFI describes an interface for calling C
      functions from Scheme, calling Scheme functions from C, and allocating
      storage in the Scheme heap. Scheme manages stub functions in C that
      negotiate between the calling conventions of Scheme and C and the memory
      allocation policies of both worlds.
      <p>The following facilities are available for
      interfacing between Scheme and C:
      <ul>
        <li>Scheme code can call C functions.
        <li>The external interface provides full
        introspection for all Scheme objects. External code may inspect,
        modify, and allocate Scheme objects arbitrarily.
        <li>External code may signal errors to the
        Scheme system.
        <li>External code may call back into Scheme.
        Scheme correctly unrolls the process stack on non-local exits.
        <li>External modules may register bindings of
        names to values with a central registry accessible from Scheme.
        Conversely, Scheme code can register shared bindings for access by C
        code.
      </ul>
      <p>The interface is closely based on that of
      <a href="http://www.s48.org/">Scheme 48</a> and <a href="http://www.scsh.net/">scsh</a>.
