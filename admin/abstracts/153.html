<p><em>Osets</em> are immutable collections that can contain any Scheme
  object. Osets enforce the constraint that no two elements can be the same
  in the sense of the oset's associated <em>equality predicate</em>
  The elements in an oset appear in a fixed order determined by the
  comparator used to create it.</p>
