      <p><em>Isets</em> and <em>ibags</em> (also known
      as multisets) are immutable collections that can contain any Scheme
      object. Isets enforce the constraint that no two elements can be the same
      in the sense of the iset's associated <em>equality predicate</em>; ibags
      do not. The elements in an iset or ibag appear in a fixed order
      determined by the comparator used to create it.
