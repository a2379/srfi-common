      <p>This SRFI defines immutable deques. A deque is
      a double-ended queue, a sequence which allows elements to be added or
      removed efficiently from either end. A structure is immutable when all
      its operations leave the structure unchanged. Note that none of the
      procedures specified here ends with an exclamation point.
