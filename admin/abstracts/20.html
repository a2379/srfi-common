      <p>This SRFI presents an object system to define
      classes, generic functions as well as to support some level of
      introspection. This object system is based on Meroon-V3 which is itself
      inspired by CLOS. <a href=
      "http://www-spi.lip6.fr/~queinnec/WWW/Meroon.html">Meroon-V3</a> is
      distributed and used since 1992.
