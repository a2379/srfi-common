      <p>A means to denote the invalidity of certain
      code paths in a Scheme program is proposed. It allows Scheme code to turn
      the evaluation into a user-defined error that need not be signalled by
      the implementation. Optimizing compilers may use these denotations to
      produce better code and to issue better warnings about dead code.
