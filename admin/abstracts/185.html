<p>
Scheme specifies mutable fixed-length strings.
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-118/srfi-118.html">SRFI 118</a>
adds two procedures <code>string-append!</code> and
<code>string-replace!</code> which allow the length of the string to change.
This SRFI provides two linear-update versions of these procedures:
that is, the implementation may change the string length or return a
new string instead.
In addition, two convenience macros are provided that make the
procedures somewhat easier to use.
