      <p>The <code>define-immutable</code> form defines an
      identifier whose value never changes.
      <p>The expression part of the definition is
      evaluated lazily: it is not evaluated unless and until the identifier is
      evaluated. This permits an immutable definition to use other definitions
      in more ways than is possible when using <code>define</code> in internal
      definitions.
      <p>A series of immutable definitions have simple
      semantics, making them easy to program and understand.
