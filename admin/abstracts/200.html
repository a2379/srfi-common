<p>This SRFI discusses some of the existing pattern-matching
  libraries for the Scheme programming language &mdash; namely,
  the pattern matcher presented by Andrew K. Wright and Robert
  Cartwright in the paper "A Soft Type System for Scheme", the
  pattern matcher developed by Dan Friedman, Erik Hilsdale and
  Kent Dybvig, the <code>racket/match</code> module
  distributed with the Racket programming environment, as well
  as the Bigloo and Gerbil pattern matchers distributed with
  their respective implementations.
  It then extracts a pattern syntax which is compatible with three of
  those implementations and provides extrinsic rationale for that
  syntax.
  It also provides a simple implementation of a pattern matcher
  which conforms to the specification of a pattern language provided
  in this document.</p>
