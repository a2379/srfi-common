<p>This SRFI discusses the most widespread existing pattern matching libraries
  for the Scheme programming language - namely, the pattern matcher
  presented by Andrew K. Wright and Robert Cartwright in the paper "A Soft
  Type System for Scheme", the pattern matcher developed by Dan Friedman,
  Erik Hilsdale and Kent Dybvig, and the <code>racket/match</code> module
  distributed with the Racket programming environment.
  It then extracts a pattern syntax which is compatible with two of
  those implementations and provides extrinsic rationale for that syntax.
  It also provides a simple implementation of a pattern matcher
  which conforms to the specification of a pattern language provided
  in this document.</p>
