    <p>This SRFI defines a rich set of control operators for the
      Scheme programming language, including the
      venerable <code>call/cc</code>
      (<code>call-with-current-continuation</code>).  The set of
      operators was highly influenced by the control operators provided
      by <a href="https://racket-lang.org/"><cite>Racket</cite></a>.

    <p>Continuations can be delimited by continuation prompts, and all
      continuations become delimited continuations, at the latest by
      the default prompt at the start of each thread.  Moreover,
      continuations are divided into composable and non-composable
      continuations, which can be captured and reinstated.</p>

    <p>To investigate continuations, this SRFI supports continuation
      marks and offers operators to set and retrieve them.</p>

    <p>Moreover, this SRFI defines clear semantics of
      exceptions, parameter objects, promises, and threads consistent
      with the other concepts defined here.</p>
