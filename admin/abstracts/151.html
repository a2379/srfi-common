      <p>This SRFI proposes a coherent and comprehensive
      set of procedures for performing bitwise logical operations on integers;
      it is accompanied by a reference implementation of the spec in terms of a
      set of seven core operators. The sample implementation is portable, as
      efficient as practical with pure Scheme arithmetic (it is much more
      efficient to replace the core operators with C or assembly language if
      possible), and open source.
      <p>The precise semantics of these operators is
      almost never an issue. A consistent, portable set of <em>names</em> and
      <em>parameter conventions</em>, however, is. Hence this SRFI, which is
      based mainly on <a href="/srfi-33/">SRFI 33</a>, with some changes and
      additions from <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-33/mail-archive/msg00023.html">Olin's late
      revisions to SRFI 33</a> (which were never consummated). <a href="/srfi-60/">SRFI 60</a> (based on SLIB) is smaller but has a few
      procedures of its own; some of its procedures have both native (often
      Common Lisp) and SRFI 33 names. They have been incorporated into this
      SRFI. <a href="http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs-lib/r6rs-lib-Z-H-12.html#node_sec_11.4">
      R6RS</a> is a subset of SRFI 60, except that all procedure names begin
      with a <code>bitwise-</code> prefix. A few procedures have been added from
      the general vector <a href="/srfi-133/">SRFI 133</a>.
      <p>Among the applications of bitwise operations
      are: hashing, Galois-field calculations of error-detecting and
      error-correcting codes, cryptography and ciphers, pseudo-random number
      generation, register-transfer-level modeling of digital logic designs,
      Fast-Fourier transforms, packing and unpacking numbers in persistent data
      structures, space-filling curves with applications to dimension reduction
      and sparse multi-dimensional database indexes, and generating approximate
      seed values for root-finders and transcendental function
      algorithms.
      <p>This SRFI differs from SRFI 142 in only two
      ways:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>The <code>bitwise-if</code> function has the
          argument ordering of SLIB, SRFI 60, and R6RS rather than the ordering
          of SRFI 33.
        <li>
          <p>The order in which bits are processed by
          the procedures listed in the "Bits conversion" section has been
          clarified and some of the procedures' names have been changed. See
          "Bit processing order" for details.
