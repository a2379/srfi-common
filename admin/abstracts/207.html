<p>To ease the human reading and writing of Scheme code involving
binary data that for mnemonic reasons corresponds
as a whole or in part to ASCII-coded text, a notation
for bytevectors is defined which allows printable ASCII characters
to be used literally without being converted to their corresponding
integer forms. In addition, this SRFI provides a set of procedures
known as the bytestring library
for constructing a bytevector from a sequence of integers,
characters, strings, and/or bytevectors, and for manipulating
bytevectors as if they were strings as far as possible.
