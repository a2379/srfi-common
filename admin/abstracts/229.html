    <p>This SRFI defines <dfn>tagged procedures</dfn>, which are procedures
      that are tagged with a Scheme value when created through the
      syntax <code>lambda/tag</code> and <code>case-lambda/tag</code>.  The
      value of the tag of a procedure can be retrieved
      with <code>procedure-tag</code>, and the
      predicate <code>procedure/tag?</code> discerns whether a procedure is
      tagged.</p>
