<p>This SRFI specifies an array mechanism for Scheme. Arrays as defined here are quite general; at their most basic, an array is simply a mapping, or function, from multi-indices of exact integers $i_0,\ldots,i_{d-1}$ to Scheme values.  The set of multi-indices $i_0,\ldots,i_{d-1}$ that are valid for a given array form the <i>domain</i> of the array.  In this SRFI, each array's domain consists  of the cross product of nonempty intervals of exact integers $[l_0,u_0)\times[l_1,u_1)\times\cdots\times[l_{d-1},u_{d-1})$ of $\mathbb Z^d$, $d$-tuples of integers.  Thus, we introduce a data type called $d$-<i>intervals</i>, or more briefly <i>intervals</i>, that encapsulates this notion. (We borrow this terminology from, e.g.,  Elias Zakon's <a href="http://www.trillia.com/zakon1.html">Basic Concepts of Mathematics</a>.) Specialized variants of arrays are specified to provide portable programs with efficient representations for common use cases.</p>
