<p>This SRFI defines a standard command-line flag to get version
  information from a Scheme implementation.  The output is
  Line-oriented S-expressions which are easy to parse from Scheme, C,
  and shell scripts and can co-exist with non-S-expression output.  A
  standard vocabulary is defined; extensions are easy to make.</p>
