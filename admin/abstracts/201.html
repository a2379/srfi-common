<p>This document describes a handful of syntactic extensions
  to the core bindings of the Scheme programming language.
  In particular, it proposes to extend the binding forms
  <code>lambda</code>, <code>let</code>,
  <code>let*</code> with pattern matching capabilities, to extend the forms <code>let</code>
  and <code>or</code> with the ability
  to handle multiple values, and to extend the form <code>define</code> with
  the ability of defining "curried" functions.</p>
