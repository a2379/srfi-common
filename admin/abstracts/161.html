<p>
  Unifiable boxes are, like the boxes
  of <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-111/srfi-111.html">SRFI
    111</a>, objects with a single mutable state.  A constructor,
  predicate, accessor, and mutator are provided.
</p>

<p>
In addition to this, an equality predicate and union operations (link,
union, unify) are provided.  Applying a union operation to two
unifiable boxes makes the two boxes equal (in the sense of the
equality predicate).  As a consequence, their state will also become
identical.  In the case of link and union, it will be the state of one
of the two unioned boxes.  In the case of unify, the state is
determined by a supplied unification procedure.
