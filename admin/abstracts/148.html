      <p>Writing powerful <code>syntax-rules</code>
      macros is hard because they do not compose well: The arguments of a macro
      expansion are not expanded. This SRFI defines an easy to comprehend
      high-level system for writing powerful, composable (or <em>eager</em>)
      macros, two of whose defining features are that its macro arguments are
      (in general) eagerly expanded and that it can be portably implemented in
      any Scheme implementation conforming to the R7RS.
