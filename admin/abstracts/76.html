      <p>This SRFI describes abstractions for creating
      new data types representing records - data structures with named fields.
      This SRFI comes in four parts:
      <ul>
        <li>a procedural layer for creating and
        manipulating record types and record instances
        <li>an explicit-naming syntactic layer for
        defining the various entities associated with a record type -
        construction procedure, predicate, field accessors, mutators, etc. - at
        once
        <li>an implicit-naming syntactic layer built on
        top of the explicit-naming syntactic layer, which chooses the names for
        the various products based on the names of the record type and
        fields
        <li>a set of reflection procedures
      </ul>
