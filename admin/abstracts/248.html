    <p>
      Scheme's exception system is extended so that exception handlers
      gain access to the delimited continuation representing the rest
      of the computation of the call of the thunk guarded by the
      handler.  Algebraic effect handlers can be directly expressed in
      this extended exception system.  The system directly implements
      the <code>shift0</code>/<code>reset0</code> delimited control
      operators.  It is well known that other delimited control
      operators like <code>prompt0</code>/<code>control0</code> or
      <code>reset</code>/<code>shift</code> are expressible
      in <code>shift0</code>/<code>reset0</code> (and vice versa).
