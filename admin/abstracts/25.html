      <p>A core set of procedures for creating and
      manipulating heterogeneous multidimensional arrays is proposed. The
      design is consistent with the rest of Scheme and independent of other
      container data types. It provides easy sharing of parts of an array as
      other arrays without copying, encouraging a declarative style of
      programming.
      <p>The specification is based on an original
      contribution by Alan Bawden in 1993.
