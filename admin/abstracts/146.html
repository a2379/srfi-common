      <p><em>Mappings</em> are finite sets of
      associations, where each association is a pair consisting of a key and an
      arbitrary Scheme value. The keys are elements of a suitable domain. Each
      mapping holds no more than one association with the same key. The
      fundamental mapping operation is retrieving the value of an association
      stored in the mapping when the key is given.
