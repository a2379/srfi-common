      <p>Lazy sequences (or lseqs, pronounced
      "ell-seeks") are a generalization of lists. In particular, an lseq is
      either a proper list or a dotted list whose last cdr is a <a href=
      "/srfi-121/">SRFI 121</a> generator. A generator is a procedure that can
      be invoked with no arguments in order to lazily supply additional
      elements of the lseq. When a generator has no more elements to return, it
      returns an end-of-file object. Consequently, lazy sequences cannot
      reliably contain end-of-file objects.
      <p>This SRFI provides a set of procedures suitable
      for operating on lazy sequences based on <a href="/srfi-1/">SRFI
      1</a>.
