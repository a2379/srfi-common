<p>Ranges are collections somewhat similar to vectors, except that
  they are immutable and have algorithmic representations instead of
  the uniform per-element data structure of vectors. The storage required is
  usually less than the size of the same collection stored in a
  vector and the time needed to reference a particular element is
  typically less for a range than for the same collection stored in a
  list. This SRFI defines a large subset of the sequence operations
  defined on lists, vectors, strings, and other collections.  If
  necessary, a range can be converted to a list, vector, or string of
  its elements or a generator that will lazily produce each element in
  the range.</p>
