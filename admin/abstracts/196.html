<p>Ranges are immutable collections that can be enumerated but are
represented algorithmically rather than by a per-element data
structure.  This SRFI defines a large subset of the sequence operations
defined on lists, vectors, and other collections.  If necessary,
a range can be converted to a list or vector of its elements or a generator
that will lazily produce each element in the range.</p>
