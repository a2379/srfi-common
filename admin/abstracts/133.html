      <p>This SRFI proposes a comprehensive library of
      vector operations accompanied by a freely available and complete
      reference implementation. The reference implementation is unencumbered by
      copyright, and useable with no modifications on any Scheme system that is
      R5RS-compliant. It also provides several hooks for
      implementation-specific optimization as well.
