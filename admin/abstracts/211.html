<p>This SRFI describes common syntactic extensions of the <code>syntax-rules</code> macro facility of R5RS and the base R6RS and R7RS libraries.  In particular,
      library namespaces are defined where these extensions can be located
      and which can be tested against in <code>cond-expand</code> forms.
