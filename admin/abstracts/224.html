<p>Integer maps, or <em>imappings</em>, are finite sets, where each element is
an association between an exact-integer key and an arbitrary Scheme
object.  They are similar to the general mappings of
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-146/">SRFI
146</a>, but the restricted key-type allows implementations of
imappings to benefit from optimized structures and algorithms.  This
library provides a rich set of operations on imappings, including
analogues of most of the forms provided by SRFI 146.  Imappings have
no intrinsic order, but may be treated as ordered sets, using the
natural ordering on keys; a substantial sublibrary for working with
imappings in this fashion is included.</p>
