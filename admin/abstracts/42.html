      <p>This SRFI defines a modular and portable
      mechanism for eager comprehensions extending the algorithmic language
      Scheme [R5RS]. An eager comprehension is a convenient notation for one or
      more nested or parallel loops generating a sequence of values, and
      accumulating this sequence into a result.
