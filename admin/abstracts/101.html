      <p>Random-access lists [1] are a purely functional
      data structure for representing lists of values. A random-access list may
      act as a drop in replacement for the usual linear-access pair and list
      data structures (<code>pair?</code>, <code>cons</code>, <code>car</code>,
      <code>cdr</code>), which additionally supports fast index-based
      addressing and updating (<code>list-ref</code>, <code>list-set</code>).
      The impact is a whole class of purely-functional algorithms expressed in
      terms of index-based list addressing become feasible compared with their
      linear-access list counterparts.
      <p>This document proposes a library API for purely
      functional random-access lists consistent with the R<sup>6</sup>RS [2]
      base library and list utility standard library [3].
