<p>
   This SRFI follows
    <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-203/">
     SRFI 203
    </a>
   in providing "out-of-the-box" support for hosting the exercises suggested by
    <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html">
     Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
    </a>
   in portable Scheme.
</p>

<p>
Whereas SRFI 203 focused on the necessarily unportable aspects of the problem set (the graphics), this SRFI aims to provide support for the rest of the features, which are fare more widespread, often already provided, and in reality mostly need just a common vocabulary.
</p>

<p>
This SRFI provides subroutines for working with time data, multi-threading, streams and SICP names for <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.
</p>

<p>
None of these subroutines are fit for production use, and are only designed for pedagogical purposes.
</p>

<p>
 Students, however, are expected to be able to just write
 <pre>
 (include (srfi sicp))</pre>
and have the code from the book run without problems (apart from those intended by the book authors).
