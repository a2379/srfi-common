<p>The SRFI-2 library introduced the <code>and-let*</code> form
  for short-circuited evaluation in the style of the <code>and</code>
  form with the ability to capture the (non-<code>#f</code>) results
  in the style of the <code>let*</code> form. This document extends
  the <code>and-let*</code> form with the abilities to pattern-match
  (or "destructurally bind") the values of evaluated expressions
  (where the match failure causes short-circuiting rather than
  raising an error), and to handle multiple values (where only the
  falsehood of the first value causes short-circuiting).
