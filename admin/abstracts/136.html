      <p>SRFI 9 and the compatible R7RS-small provide
      Scheme with record types. The basic problem that is solved by these
      record types is that they allow the user to introduce new types, disjoint
      from all existing types. The record type system described in this
      document is a conservative extension to SRFI 9 and R7RS record types (in
      other words, the keyword <code>define-record-type</code> defined in this
      specification can serve as the equally named keyword from SRFI 9 and R7RS
      and can thus be safely exported from <code>(srfi 9)</code> and
      <code>(scheme base)</code>) that is intended to solve another fundamental
      problem, namely the introduction of subtypes.
