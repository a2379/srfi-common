    <p>This SRFI defines a language to describe control-flow graphs
      (CFGs) suitable for formulating iterative and recursive
      algorithms.  Using the notion of a CFG term, this language can
      be seamlessly embedded in the Scheme language.  Complex CFG
      terms can be composed from simple CFG terms.</p>
