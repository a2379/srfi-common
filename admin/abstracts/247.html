    <p>This SRFI extends Scheme with a simple mechanism to implicitly add
      formal arguments to procedure definitions and to implicitly add
      arguments to procedure calls.  Contrary to parameters (also known as fluids
      or dynamically bound variables), which can be used for the same
      purpose, no runtime overhead is generated.</p>
