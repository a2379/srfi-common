      <p>This SRFI defines a comprehensive I/O subsystem
      for Scheme with three layers, where each layer is built on top of the one
      below it:
      <ul>
        <li>The lowest, primitive layer provides
        unbuffered I/O, and is close to what a typical operating system
        offers.
        <li>The middle layer builds on lazy, mostly
        functional buffered streams.
        <li>The upper layer is similar in nature to the
        ports subsystem in R5RS, and provides conventional, imperative buffered
        input and output.
      </ul>
      <p>The layer architecture is similar to the upper
      three layers of the I/O subsystem in <a href=
      "http://www.standardml.org/Basis/">The Standard ML Basis
      Library</a>.
      <p>In particular, the subsystem provides
      <ul>
        <li>buffered reading and writing
        <li>arbitrary lookahead at the streams
        level
        <li>dynamic redirection of input or output at
        the ports level
        <li>binary and text I/O, mixed if needed
        <li>translated data streams
        <li>unbuffered I/O at the primitive layer
        <li>the ability to create arbitrary I/O streams,
        such as to and from blobs and strings
      </ul>
      <p>The subsystem does <em>not</em> provide
      <ul>
        <li>formatted I/O
        <li>non-blocking or selective I/O
        <li>portable filenames, or any functionality for
        manipulating filenames
        <li>filesystem operations
        <li>socket I/O
        <li>extremely high-throughput or zero-copy
        I/O
      </ul>
      <p>However, all of these could be added on top of
      one or several of the layers specified in this SRFI.
