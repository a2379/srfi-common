Scheme has traditionally required procedure bodies and the bodies of derived constructs
such as <code>let</code> to contain definitions followed by commands/expressions.
This SRFI proposes to allow mixing commands and groups of definitions in such bodies, so that each
command/expression is in the scope of all local definition groups preceding it, but not in scope of
the local definition groups following it. This approach is backwards compatible with R7RS and
upholds the intuitive rule that to find the definition of a lexical variable, one has
to look <em>up</em> the source code tree.
