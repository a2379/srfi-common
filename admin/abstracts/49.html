      <p>This SRFI descibes a new syntax for Scheme,
      called I-expressions, whith equal descriptive power as S-expressions. The
      syntax uses indentation to group expressions, and has no special cases
      for semantic constructs of the language. It can be used both for program
      and data input.
      <p>It also allows mixing S-expressions and
      I-expressions freely, giving the programmer the ability to layout the
      code as to maximize readability.
