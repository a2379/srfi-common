      <p>This SRFI proposes text to replace section 6.2
      "Numbers" of R5RS in order to extend its capabilities, correct errors in
      its specification, make it more explicit about limitations of precision
      and magnitude, and improve portability between implementations. More
      specifically, this new text:
      <ul>
        <li>incorporates an inexact real positive
        infinity and an inexact real negative infinity,
        <li>extends number syntax to incorporate inexact
        real infinities,
        <li>adapts Common-Lisp semantics for
        <samp>`expt'</samp> and extends them to include inexact real
        infinities,
        <li>corrects the description of
        <samp>`sqrt'</samp>,
        <li>sharpens the distinction between exact and
        inexact numbers,
        <li>removes a contradiction related to
        exactness,
        <li>extends <samp>`gcd'</samp> and
        <samp>`lcm'</samp> to exact rational numbers,
        <li>extends <samp>`quotient'</samp>,
        <samp>`modulo'</samp>, and <samp>`remainder'</samp> to finite real
        numbers,
        <li>clarifies the behavior of
        <samp>`inexact-&gt;exact'</samp> applied to an exact argument,
        <li>clarifies the behavior of
        <samp>`exact-&gt;inexact'</samp> applied to an inexact argument,
        <li>adds convenience procedures
        <samp>`exact-round'</samp>, <samp>`exact-ceiling'</samp>,
        <samp>`exact-floor'</samp>, and <samp>`exact-truncate'</samp>,
        <li>and adds examples.
      </ul>
