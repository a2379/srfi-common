	<p>
	  This SRFI provides a specification and portable implementation of an
	  extension of the ERR5RS record syntax
	  of <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-131/srfi-131.html">SRFI
	  131</a>, where field names inserted by macro transformers are
	  effectively renamed as if the macro transformer inserted a binding.
	  This makes this SRFI compatible with the semantics of the record-type
	  definitions of
	  the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/cowan/r7rs/src/draft-10/rnrs/r7rs.pdf">R7RS</a>
	  as intended by
	  its <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scheme-reports-wg2/oKuhgwaM45w/KXgPrh8oAwAJ">authors</a>.
	  In addition, field names may also be other types of Scheme datums,
	  like numbers and strings, or
	  <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-88/srfi-88.html">SRFI 88</a> keyword objects.
