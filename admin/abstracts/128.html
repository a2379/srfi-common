      <p>This SRFI provides <i>comparators</i>, which
      bundle a type test predicate, an equality predicate, an ordering
      predicate, and a hash function (the last two are optional) into a single
      Scheme object. By packaging these procedures together, they can be
      treated as a single item for use in the implementation of data
      structures.
