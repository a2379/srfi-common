      <p>This is a proposal to allow procedure calls
      that evaluate to the "value of a location" to be used to <em>set</em> the
      value of the location, when used as the first operand of
      <code>set!</code>.For example:
      <pre>
(set! (car x) (car y))
</pre>becomes equivalent to
      <pre>
(set-car! x (car y))
</pre>
      <p>Many programming languages have the concept of
      an <i>lvalue</i>. that is an "expression" that "evaluates" to a location,
      and which can appear on the left-hand-side of an assignment. Common Lisp
      has a related concept of "generalized variables" which can be used in
      <code>setf</code> and some other special forms. However, the Common Lisp
      concept is based on the idea of compile-time recognition of special
      "location-producing" functions; this does not seem to be in the "spirit
      of Scheme".
      <p>This SRFI proposes an extension of
      <code>set!</code> so that it provides similar functionality as Common
      Lisp's <code>setf</code>, except that the updater is associated with a
      procedure value, rather than a name.
