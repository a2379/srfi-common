      <p>Points in time are represented as the number of
      seconds (with nanosecond precision) since "the epoch," a zero point in
      time. Several standard variants are defined, including UTC (universal
      coordinated time), TAI (international atomic time), and monotonic time. A
      point in time can also be represented as a Julian Day or Modified Julian
      Day number. Time durations, including time spent in a process or thread,
      are defined. Conversion routines are provided. The procedure CURRENT-TIME
      queries the current time in a specified variant, with a system-dependent
      resolution. Procedures for time arithmetic and time comparisons are also
      provided.
      <p>A date is a representation of a point in time
      in the Gregorian calendar, a 24 hour clock (with nanosecond precision)
      and a time zone offset from UTC. Procedures for converting between time
      and dates are provided, as well as for reading and writing string
      representations of dates.
