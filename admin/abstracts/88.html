      <p>This SRFI defines <i>keyword</i> objects, a
      data type similar to Scheme symbols. Keyword objects have the same
      lexical syntax as symbols but they must end in a colon. Moreover keyword
      objects are self-evaluating. Procedures for converting between strings
      and keyword objects (<code>string-&gt;keyword</code> and
      <code>keyword-&gt;string</code>) and a type predicate (<code>keyword?</code>) are
      defined. Finally this SRFI specifies the changes to the Scheme lexical
      syntax required to accomodate keywords.
