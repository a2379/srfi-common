      <p>This SRFI extends Scheme with procedures to
      read and write binary data to and from ports, including utility
      procedures for writing various integer and floating point values in both
      big and little endian formats. Predicates are provided to test if binary
      I/O is allowed on a port, along with new procedures for creating such
      ports.
