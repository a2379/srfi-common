<p>This SRFI introduces a macro, DEFINE-RECORD-LAMBDA, that defines a
  set of procedures, that is, a group of constructors and a predicate.
  The constructors also make a group of procedures, namely record
  lambdas, that have no explicit field accessors and mutators.  They
  can have various kinds of fields, such as common fields, required
  fields, optional fields, automatic fields, read-only fields,
  read-write fields, invisible fields, immutable fields, and virtual
  fields.</p>
