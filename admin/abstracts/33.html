      <p>R5RS Scheme has no utilities for performing
      bitwise logical operations on integers or bitstrings, which is a problem
      for authors of portable code. This SRFI proposes a coherent and
      comprehensive set of these functions; it is accompanied by a reference
      implementation of the spec in terms of a set of seven core operators. The
      reference implementation is
      <ul>
        <li>portable
        <li>efficient
        <li>completely open, public-domain source
      </ul>
      <p>The precise semantics of these operators is
      almost never an issue. A consistent, portable set of <b>names</b> and
      <b>parameter conventions</b>, however, is. Hence this SRFI.
