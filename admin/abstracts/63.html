      <p>The SRFI, which is to supersede <a href=
      "srfi-47/">SRFI-47</a>, "Array",
      <ul>
        <li>synthesizes array concepts from Common-Lisp
        and Alan Bawden's "array.scm";
        <li>incorporates all the uniform vector types
        from <a href="srfi-4/">SFRI-4</a> "Homogeneous numeric vector
        datatypes";
        <li>adds a boolean uniform array type;
        <li>adds 16.bit and 128.bit floating-point
        uniform-array types;
        <li>adds decimal floating-point uniform-array
        types; and
        <li>adds array types of (dual) floating-point
        complex numbers.
      </ul>Multi-dimensional arrays subsume homogeneous
      vectors as the one-dimensional case, obviating the need for SRFI-4.<br>
      <br>
      <p>SRFI-58 gives a read/write invariant syntax for
      the homogeneous and heterogeneous arrays described here.
