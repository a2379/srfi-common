    <h1><a href="/"><img class="srfi-logo" src="srfi-logo.svg" alt="SRFI surfboard logo" /></a>Scheme Requests For Implementation - Privacy Statement</h1>

    <p>The purpose of the SRFI web site is to facilitate creating and
      disseminating information about proposed additions to the Scheme
      programming language.  This work is done in public through
      documents and email messages published on this and other web
      sites.  All of the work is done by volunteers.  In support of
      this work, we use these third-party tools:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><a href="https://www.linode.com/">Linode</a>, for the
	Linux server that runs the main web site,
	<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/">srfi.schemers.org</a>.</p>

	<p>Here is <a href="https://www.linode.com/privacy">Linode's privacy policy</a>.</p>

	<p>The <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/">SRFI web site</a>
	  does not set cookies.</p>

	<p>As is standard for web sites, we maintain server logs that
	  contain IP addresses and other identifying information.  We
	  use this for debugging, for security, and for computing
	  aggregate statistics.  Our intent is that only the editors
	  are allowed access to this information.  We rotate the logs
	  approximately every two weeks, so only our backups contain
	  older log information.  However, we may indefinitely
	  preserve log entries and other information that record
	  apparent attacks on the site.</p></li>

      <li><p><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> for hosting
	code and documents that are part of the proposals.</p>
	<p>Here is <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/">GitHub's
	  privacy statement</a>.  Note that users who would prefer
	  not to use GitHub can download all the code and documents
	  <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi.tgz">here</a>
	  (<code>.tgz</code>), directly from the SRFI web site.</p></li>

      <li><p><a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> for
	hosting the open-source Noto Sans font, which includes many
	Unicode characters that other fonts don't.</p></li>

      <li><p><a href="https://www.simplelists.com/">Simplelists</a> for
	delivering email messages and for displaying those messages in
	public archives.</p>

	<p>Note that most email messages sent to SRFI email addresses
	  are displayed publicly in our archives, e.g. <a href="https://srfi-email.schemers.org/srfi-discuss">srfi-discuss</a>.
	  These archives are necessary because the point of SRFI is
	  public, transparent discussion of proposals.</p>

	<p>Simplelists obfuscates email addresses in the public
	  archives so that they can't be harvested by spammers.
	  However, since the point of the site is pubic discussion, we
	  make no attempt to conceal the identities of participants.</p>

	<p>Here are the <a href="https://www.simplelists.com/privacy.php">Simplelists
	  privacy policy</a> and <a href="https://www.simplelists.com/gdpr.php">
	  GDPR statement</a>.</p></li>

      <li>JavaScript libraries:

	<ul>
	  <li><a href="http://listjs.com/">listjs</a>, which is used
	    for live filtering, searching, and sorting of SRFI
	    proposals on the home page.</li>

	  <li><a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>, which
	    is used for displaying mathematics in some of the
	    proposals.</li></ul>

	<p>Both of these libraries are hosted by the CloudFlare CDN
	  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">Content
	  Delivery Network</a>).  Here is <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/security-policy/">CloudFlare's
	  privacy policy</a>.</p></li></ul>
