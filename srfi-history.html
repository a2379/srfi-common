    <h1>SRFI History</h1>

    <p>
      At the <a
	href="http://www.neci.nj.nec.com/homepages/kelsey/workshop.html">Scheme
	Workshop</a> held in Baltimore, Maryland, on September 26, 1998,
      the attendees considered a number of proposals for standardized
      feature sets for inclusion in Scheme implementations.  (Here are
      the <a
	href="http://www.schemers.org/Events/Workshops/Sep1998/minutes">minutes</a>.)
      </p>

    <p>
      Alan Bawden proposed that there be a <a
      href="http://www.neci.nj.nec.com/homepages/kelsey/bawden.txt">repository
      for library proposals</a>.  <a
      href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/">Shriram
	Krishnamurthi</a> volunteered to host the library, and <a
	href="http://www.sarg.ryerson.ca/dmason/">Dave Mason</a> and
	<a
	href="http://www-pu.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/users/sperber/">Mike
	Sperber</a> joined him as initial editors and coordinators of
	the library
      process.  The term "Request for Implementation," a pun on the
      Internet "Requests for Comment," was coined at the workshop, and
      modified to "Scheme Request for Implementation" by the editors.
    </p>
    
    <p>On November 1, 1998, the <code>srfi minus discuss</code> mailing list 
      was established which had as subscribers many major implementors
      of Scheme as well as other contributors to the language.  An
      archive of the discussion is <a
      href="srfi-discuss-1998/maillist.html">here</a>.</p>

    <p>The SRFI web site along with the other SRFI procedures was
      established in late December 1998.</p>

    <p>On January 27, 2002, Dave Mason and Shriram Krishnamurthi
    <a
    href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=w7dn0yzrs3j.fsf%40cs.brown.edu&output=gplain">retired</a> as SRFI editors.  At the same time, <a href="http://people.netscape.com/drush/">David Rush</a> and <a href="http://biblio06.fciencias.unam.mx/solsona/">Francisco Solsona</a> joined as new SRFI editors.</p>

    <p>On March 14, 2004, <a href="http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~dvanhorn/">David 
      Van Horn</a> joined as a new SRFI editor.</p>
    <p>On September 2, 2005, David Rush retired as SRFI editor; at the
    same time, <a href="http://www.rscheme.org/~donovan/">Donovan
      Kolbly</a> joined as a new SRFI editor.</p>
