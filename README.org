The purpose of the Scheme Requests for Implementation (*SRFI*) process
is to help Scheme users write portable, useful code.  We write
concrete, detailed proposals and reference implementations for
libraries and other additions to the Scheme language, and we encourage
Scheme implementors to adopt them.

If you're interested in reading existing proposals, writing a new one,
providing feedback on a draft proposal, helping with a reference
implementation, or reporting a bug, please read about [[srfi-process.html][our process]],
skim our [[srfi-faq.html][FAQ]], and [[srfi-list-subscribe.html][subscribe]] to some of our mailing lists.

In addition to the complete list above, there are detailed lists of
[[draft-srfis.html][draft]], [[final-srfis.html][final]], and [[withdrawn-srfis.html][withdrawn]] SRFIs.

Every SRFI is hosted on Github, but if you'd like a complete archive
of all SRFI documents and code, please download [[srfi.tgz][srfi.tgz]].

The SRFI process has been important to the development of some of the
official Scheme standards, including [[http://www.r6rs.org/][R6RS]] and [[http://r7rs.org][R7RS]].  It has been
running [[srfi-history.html][since 1998]], and there have been many [[srfi-editors.html][different editors]].

Here's a graph of the total number of SRFIs since [[../srfi-0][SRFI 0]] was published
on 1999/1/5:
