*N.B.: This is not the official SRFI web site.  The official site is http://srfi.schemers.org/.*

*This repository matches the official site as of Fri 26 Jun 2015, including the mailing list archives.*

*For more information on my proposal, see [[file:hosting-on-github.html][Hosting]].  Michael Sperber, current editor, has [[http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.scheme.srfi.announce/117][approved my proposal]], so now the work begins in earnest!*

The "Scheme Requests for Implementation" (*SRFI*) process is a new
approach to helping Scheme users to write portable and yet useful
code.  It is a forum for people interested in coordinating libraries
and other additions to the Scheme language between implementations.
