Arrays as defined here are quite general; at their most basic, an array is simply a mapping, or function, from multi-indices of exact integers $i_0,\ldots,i_{d-1}$ to Scheme values.  The set of multi-indices $i_0,\ldots,i_{d-1}$ that are valid for a given array form the <i>domain</i> of the array.  In this SRFI, each array's domain consists  of the cross product of intervals of exact integers $[l_0,u_0)\times[l_1,u_1)\times\cdots\times[l_{d-1},u_{d-1})$ of $\mathbb Z^d$, $d$-tuples of integers.  Thus, we introduce a data type called $d$-<i>intervals</i>, or more briefly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Interval_(mathematics)&amp;oldid=1091935326"><i>intervals</i></a>, that encapsulates this notion.

    there is a continuation awaiting the values of the expression. It is a
    distinguishing property of the Scheme programming language to offer a
    procedure (named <code>call/cc</code>) that captures the current
    continuation as a procedure, which, when called, aborts the then current
    continuation and reinstates the captured one.</p>

    <p>One can visualize a continuation as a list of (continuation) frames
      where a non-tail call adds a frame to the top of the list and where the return
      from a non-tail call removes the appropriate frame.</p>

    <p>Moreover, each expression is evaluated in a dynamic environment that
      conceptually holds the values of parameters like the current output port
      and the dynamic-wind stack at the point of evaluation.  As the dynamic
      environment is captured and reinstated along the continuation when the
      <code>call/cc</code> machinery is used, we can view it conceptually as
      part of the continuation.</p>

    <p>The libraries defined in this SRFI are all concerned with continuations
      in a wider sense. More specifically, the topics are as follows:</p>

    <p><i>Continuation Prompts:</i> A continuation prompt is a special
    continuation frame, which is tagged with a so-called prompt tag. Procedures
    to install continuation prompts and to abort the current continuation and
    to escape back to a previously installed continuation prompt are
    provided. Moreover, continuation prompts are equipped with handlers that
    are invoked when a continuation is aborted to them.</p>

    <p><i>Continuations:</i> When continuations are captured, the list of
    captured continuation frames are always delimited by some continuation
    prompt. This extends the semantics of Scheme‚Äôs
    <code>call-with-current-continuation</code>.  Moreover, a
    procedure to capture so-called composable continuations is
    provided. As opposed to continuations captured
    by <code>call-with-current-continuation</code>, invoking a
    composable continuation does not abort the then current
    continuation, so composable continuations behave like ordinary
    procedures.  Together with continuation prompts, composable
    continuations allow one to implement the various proposed sets of
    control operators for delimited continuations. Finally, a
    primitive (<code>call-in-continuation</code>) is provided that
    allows calling a thunk in a given continuation instead of just
    delivering values to it.</p>

    <p><i>Continuation Marks:</i> Continuation marks are a provided feature
      that allows one to attach arbitrary information to continuation frames,
      which are captured and reinstated along the rest of the
      continuation. Conceptually, exception handlers and parameters are
      implemented in terms of continuation marks, but the syntax and procedures
      defined in this SRFI allow the user to use them in more general
      ways. Moreover, they reify the notion of a tail call, allowing, for
      example, to test for tail context.</p>

    <p><i>Exceptions:</i> The exception mechanism
    of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0956796809990074">R6RS</a>
    and <a href="https://small.r7rs.org/attachment/r7rs.pdf">R7RS</a> is reinterpreted with
    respect to the concepts introduced in this SRFI.  Moreover, the
    <code>with-exception-handler</code> procedure and the <code>guard</code>
    syntax gain additional tail context guarantees.</p>

    <p><i>Parameters:</i> The parameter object mechanism
    of <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-39/srfi-39.html">SRFI 39</a>
    and R7RS is reinterpreted with respect to the
    concepts introduced in this SRFI.  Procedures to retrieve the
    current parameterization and to reinstall it later are
    provided. Moreover, the parameterize syntax gains an additional
    tail context guarantee.</p>

    <p><i>Delayed evaluation:</i> The syntax and procedures on delayed
      evaluation of R7RS are revisited and redefined to handle the
      following satisfactorily: the parameterization of the delayed expression
      being forced, the treatment of exceptions raised during forcing of
      delayed expressions, and iterative lazy algorithms. Moreover, their
      semantics are detailed with respect to the concepts introduced in this
      SRFI, and promises can naturally deliver an arbitrary number of values
      when being forced. Finally, the initial continuation of a delayed
      expression being forced is defined in a way that makes it interchangeably
      with the initial continuation of a thread.</p>

    <p><i>Threads:</i> The thread mechanism of <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-18/srfi-18.html">SRFI
      18</a> is detailed with respect to the concepts introduced in this
      SRFI.  In particular, mutation of parameter objects in multithreaded
      applications is specified.<code></code>.</p>

In this SRFI, each array's domain consists  of the cross product of nonempty intervals of exact integers $[l_0,u_0)\times[l_1,u_1)\times\cdots\times[l_{d-1},u_{d-1})$ of $\mathbb Z^d$, $d$-tuples of integers.  Thus, we introduce a data type called $d$-<i>intervals</i>, or more briefly <i>intervals</i>, that encapsulates this notion. (We borrow this terminology from, e.g.,  Elias Zakon's <a href="http://www.trillia.com/zakon1.html">Basic Concepts of Mathematics</a>.) Specialized variants of arrays are specified to provide portable programs with efficient representations for common use cases.</p></blockquote></description><dc:creator>Bradley J.

uses an explicit representation for multiple return values as a single

by simple application.  The macro, ADBMAL, evaluates to a procedure
that takes one procedure argument.  The ADBMAL macro can be compared
with LAMBDA.  While a LAMBDA expression that consists of
&lt;formals> and &lt;body> requires some actual arguments later
when the evaluated LAMBDA expression is called, an ADBMAL expression
that consists of &lt;expression>s corresponding to actual arguments
of LAMBDA requires &lt;formals> and &lt;body>, that is, an

	  Scheme, like ML, is a programming language with strict evaluation
	  while others, like Haskell, use lazy evaluation.  Scheme, however,
	  possesses the primitives <code>delay</code> and <code>force</code>
	  that make it possible to express lazy algorithms.

	</p><p>
	  Lazy evaluation does not go well in conjunction with imperative,
	  non-functional, side-effecting code.  It should, however, be
	  applicable in a purely functional setting.  This is the case for the
	  delayed evaluation model as described in the R7RS as long as no
	  dynamically bound variables, also known as parameter objects, are
	  present.  It is the purpose of this SRFI to rework the specification
	  in the R7RS so that lazy evaluation works with purely functional code
	  that makes use of dynamic environments or, more generally, the dynamic
	  extent.  This is done by remembering the dynamic extent in effect when
	  the <code>delay</code> expression is evaluated.

	</p><p>
	  Another perceived misfeature of the R7RS model of delayed evaluation
	  is the apparent need of the <code>delay-force</code> special form to
	  express iterative lazy algorithms.  It is shown that
	  the <code>delay-force</code> special form is unneeded and that the

  Continuation marks are a programming language feature that allows
  one to attach information to and retrieve information from
  continuations, generalizing stack inspection.  Conceptually, a
  continuation consists of a number of frames where each frame stands
  for an active procedure call that is not a tail call.  A
  continuation mark is then a key-value pair associated with a frame,
  with keys compared using <code>eq?</code>.
  At most one mark for a given key can be attached to a single frame.
</p>

<p>
  Besides stack inspection, continuation marks can be used to
  implement dynamic scope, delimited continuations, or delayed
  evaluation that is able to handle iterative lazy algorithms.
</p>
<p>
  This SRFI proposes to add continuation marks to the Scheme
  programming language.  The interface defined here is modelled after
  Racket's continuation marks.  It does not include all forms and
  procedures provided by Racket but provides a compatible subset.

  A generator is simply a procedure with no arguments that works

  generator returns an end-of-file object to indicate that it is exhausted.
  For example, <code>read-char</code>, <code>read-line</code>,
  and <code>read</code> are generators that
  generate characters, lines, and objects from the current input port.
  Generators provide lightweight laziness.

      hallmarks of functional programming is lazy evaluation. A primary
      manifestation of lazy evaluation is lazy lists, generally called streams
      by Scheme programmers, where evaluation of a list element is delayed
      until its value is needed.
      </p><p>The literature on lazy evaluation distinguishes
      two styles of laziness, called even and odd. Odd style streams are
      ubiquitous among Scheme programs and can be easily encoded with the
      Scheme primitives delay and force defined in R5RS. However, the even
      style delays evaluation in a manner closer to that of traditional lazy
      languages such as Haskell and avoids an "off by one" error that is
      symptomatic of the odd style.
      </p><p>This SRFI defines the stream data type in the
      even style, some essential procedures and syntax that operate on streams,
      and motivates our choice of the even style. A companion SRFI 41 Stream

      for Scheme, called sweet-expressions (t-expressions), that has the same
      descriptive power as s-expressions but is designed to be easier for
      humans to read. The sweet-expression syntax enables the use of
      syntactically-meaningful indentation to group expressions (similar to
      Python), and it builds on the infix and traditional function notation
      defined in <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-105/">SRFI-105 (curly-infix-expressions)</a>.
      Unlike nearly all past efforts to improve s-expression readability,
      sweet-expressions are general (the notation is independent from any
      underlying semantic) and homoiconic (the underlying data structure is
      clear from the syntax). This notation was developed by the ‚Äú<a href="http://readable.sourceforge.net/">Readable Lisp S-expressions
      Project</a>‚Äù and can be used for both programs and data.
      </p><p>Sweet-expressions can be considered a set of
      additional abbreviations, just as <code>'x</code> already abbreviates
      <code>(quote x)</code>. Sweet-expressions and traditionally formatted
      s-expressions can be freely mixed; this provides backwards compatibility,
      simplifies transition, and enables developers to maximize readability.
      Here is an example of a sweet-expression and its equivalent s-expression
      (note that a sweet-expression reader would accept <em>either</em>
      format):
      <table border="1" cellpadding="4">
        <tr>
          <th>sweet-expression

      the only programming languages in modern use that do not support infix
      notation. In addition, most languages allow infix expressions to be
      combined with function call notation of the form
      <code><var>f</var>(<var>x</var>)</code>. This SRFI provides these
      capabilities, both for developers who already use Scheme and want these
      conveniences, and also for other developers who may choose to use other
      languages in part because they miss these conveniences. Scheme currently
      reserves <code>{</code>...<code>}</code> ‚Äúfor possible future extensions
      to the language‚Äù. We propose that <code>{</code>...<code>}</code> be used
      to support ‚Äúcurly-infix-expression‚Äù notation as a homoiconic infix
      abbreviation, as a modification of the Scheme reader. It is an
      abbreviation in much the same way that <samp>'x</samp> is an abbreviation
      for <samp>(quote x)</samp>.
      </p><p>A <dfn>curly-infix list</dfn> introduces a list
      whose visual presentation can be in infix order instead of prefix order.
      For example, <samp>{n > 5}</samp> ‚áí
      <samp>(> n 5)</samp>, and
      <samp>{a + b + c}</samp> ‚áí
      <samp>(+ a b c)</samp>. By intent, there is no precedence,
      but e.g., <samp>{x + {y * z}}</samp> maps cleanly to
      <samp>(+ x (* y z))</samp>. Forms with mixed infix
      operators and other complications have ‚Äú<code>$nfx$</code>‚Äù prepended to
      enable later processing, e.g.,
      <samp>{4 + 5 * 6}</samp> ‚áí
      <samp>($nfx$ 4 + 5 * 6)</samp>. Also, inside a
      curly-infix list (recursively), expressions of the form
      <code><var>f</var>(</code>...<code>)</code> are simply an abbreviation
      for <code>(<var>f</var> </code>...<code>)</code>.

      allow a wide variety of implementations. After many years of
      implementation experience, however, most implementations now fall into a
      small number of categories, and the benefits of continued experimentation
      no longer justify the confusion and portability problems that have
      resulted from giving implementations so much freedom in this area.
      Moreover, the R5RS generic arithmetic is difficult to implement as
      efficiently as purely fixnum or purely flonum arithmetic. (Fixnum
      arithmetic is typically limited-precision integer arithmetic implemented
      using one or more representations that may be especially efficient on the
      executing machine; flonum arithmetic is typically limited-precision
      floating-point arithmetic using one or more representations that may be
      especially efficient on the executing machine.)
      </p><p>This SRFI is an effort to extend and clarify
      the R5RS arithmetic to make it more portable, more comprehensive, and
      enable faster programs.
      </p><p>Furthermore, one of us (Sperber) has argued
      that Scheme's arithmetic requires radical overhaul. The other (Clinger)
      agrees that revisions are needed. Whether these revisions qualify as
      radical is best left to the judgement of individual readers.

        </li><li>defining fixnum arithmetic (parameterized by
        precision)
        </li><li>defining flonum arithmetic
        (inexactly)
        </li><li>defining new procedures for performing exact

        inexact real arithmetic using IEEE binary floating point&lt;?

        <code>eqv?</code> to behave more sensibly with inexact numbers
        </li><li>defining Scheme's real numbers to be the
        complex numbers whose imaginary part is an exact zero
        </li><li>adding an external representation for

        representation
        </li><li>defining procedures for some new operations,

      Scheme programs. As a most primitive example, the expression
      <pre>
   (check (+ 1 1) => 3)
</pre>evaluates the expression <code>(+ 1
1)</code> and compares the result with the expected result 3 provided after the
syntactic keyword <code>=></code>. Then the outcome of this comparison is
reported in human-readable form by printing a message of the form
      <pre>
   (+ 1 1) => 2 ; *** failed ***
   ; expected result: 3
</pre>Moreover, the outcome of any executed check
is recorded in a global state counting the number of correct and failed checks
and storing the first failed check. At the end of a file, or at any other
point, the user can print a summary using <code>check-report</code>.
      </p><p>In addition to the simple test above, it is
      also possible to execute a parametric sequence of checks. Syntactically,
      this takes the form of an eager comprehension in the sense of <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-42/">SRFI 42</a> [5]. For example,
      <pre>
   (check-ec (:range e 100)
             (:let x (expt 2.0 e))
             (= (+ x 1) x) => #f (e x))
</pre>This statement runs the variable <code>
      e</code> through {0..99} and for each binding defines <code>x</code> as
      <code>(expt 2.0 e)</code>. Then it is checked if <code>(+ x 1)</code> is
      equal to <code>x</code>, and it is expected that this is not the case
      (i.e. expected value is <code>#f</code>). The trailing <code>(e x)</code>
      tells the reporting mechanism to print the values of both <code>e</code>
      and <code>x</code> in case of a failed check. The output could look like
      this:
      <pre>
   (let ((e 53) (x 9007199254740992.0)) (= (+ x 1) x)) => #t ; *** failed ***
    ; expected result: #f
</pre>The specification of bindings to report,
<code>(e x)</code> in the example, is optional but very informative. Other
features of this SRFI are:
      <ul>
        <li>A way to specify a different equality
        predicate (default is <code>equal?</code>).
        </li><li>Controlling the amount of reporting being
        printed.
        </li><li>Switching off the execution and reporting of
        checks entriely.
        </li><li>Retrieving a boolean if all checks have been
        executed and passed.

      for Scheme with the following features:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Improved hygiene:</h3>
          <p>We argue that conventional hygiene
          algorithms may lead to accidental variable capture errors in
          procedural macros. We propose an improved algorithm that avoids these
          problems.
        <li>
          <h3>Reflective tower:</h3>
          <p>We specify a reflective tower of arbitrary
          height, and propose a refinement of lexical scoping that takes into
          account the phase of use of an identifier in determining its
          meaning.
        <li>
          <h3>Syntax-case:</h3>
          <p>In the current proposal, the
          <code>syntax-case</code> form is expressible as a macro in terms of a
          simpler set of primitives and is specified as library syntax.
        <li>
          <h3>Procedural interface:</h3>
          <p>The primitive interface for manipulating
          compound syntax objects consists of procedures rather than special
          forms. In particular, the traditional abstractions <code>car</code>,
          <code>cdr</code>, <code>cons</code> , <code>...</code> can be used on syntactic
          data.
        <li>
          <h3>Fast hygiene algorithm:</h3>
          <p>The reference implementation documents a
          fast imperative hygiene algorithm that is eager and linear in
          expression size.
        <li>
          <h3>Capturing identifiers:</h3>
          <p>A primitive
          <code>make-capturing-identifier</code> is provided for intentional
          variable capture and for building expansion-time fluid binding
          constructs.

      standard procedures <code>=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>char&lt;?</code> etc. of
      R<sup>5</sup>RS -- or even as a replacement. The primary design aspect in
      this SRFI is the separation of <em>representing</em> a total order and
      <em>using it.</em> For representing the order, we have chosen for truly
      3-way comparisons. For using it we provide an extensive set of
      operations, each of which accepts a procedure used for comparison. Since
      these compare procedures are often optional, comparing built-in types is
      as convenient as R<sup>5</sup>RS , sometimes more convenient: For
      example, testing if the integer index <em>i</em> lies in the integer
      range {0, <code>...</code>, <em>n</em> <code>-</code> 1} can be written as
      <code>(&lt;=/&lt;? 0 i n)</code>, implicitly invoking
      <code>default-compare</code>.
      </p><p>As soon as new total orders are required, the
      infrastructure provided by this SRFI is far more convenient and often
      even more efficient than building each total order from scratch.
      </p><p>Moreover, in case Scheme users and implementors
      find this mechanism useful and adopt it, the benefit of having a uniform
      interface to total orders to be used in data structures will manifest
      itself. Most concretely, a new sorting procedure in the spirit of this
      SRFI would have the interface <code>(my-sort [ <i>compare</i> ]
      <i>xs</i>)</code>, using <code>default-compare</code> if the optional
      <i>compare</i> was not provided. Then <code>my-sort</code> could be defined
      using the entire infrastructure of this SRFI: Efficient 2- and 3-way
      branching, testing for chains and pairwise inequality, min/max, and
      general order statistics.</p></blockquote></description><dc:creator>Sebastian Egner and Jens Axel S√∏gaard</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2005 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>SRFI 70: Numbers</title><link>https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-70/srfi-70.html</link><guid>https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-70</guid><description>SRFI 70 is now in <em>final</em> status.<blockquote>      <p>This SRFI proposes text to replace section 6.2

      <code>let</code>, <code>let*</code>, and <code>letrec</code> for
      receiving multiple values. The syntactic extension is fully compatible
      with the existing syntax. It is the intention that single-value bindings,
      i.e. <code>(let ((var expr)) ...)</code>, and multiple-value binding can
      be mixed freely and conveniently.
      </p><p>The most simple form of the new syntax is best
      explained by an example:
      <pre>
(define (quo-rem x y)
  (values (quotient x y) (remainder x y)))

(define (quo x y)
  (let ((q r (quo-rem x y)))
    q))
</pre>
      </p><p>The procedure <code>quo-rem</code> delivers two
      values to its continuation. These values are received as <code>q</code>
      and <code>r</code> in the <code>let</code>-expression of the procedure
      <code>quo</code>. In other words, the syntax of <code>let</code> is
      extended such that several variables can be specified---and these
      variables receive the values delivered by the expression <code>(quo-rem x
      y)</code>.
      </p><p>The syntax of <code>let</code> is further
      extended to cases in which a rest argument receives the list of all
      residual values. Again by example,
      <pre>
(let (((values y1 y2 . y3+) (foo x)))
   body)
</pre>In this example, <code>values</code> is a
syntactic keyword indicating the presence of multiple values to be received,
and <code>y1</code>, <code>y2</code>, and <code>y3+</code>, resp., are
variables bound to the first value, the second value, and the list of the
remaining values, resp., as produced by <code>(foo x)</code>. The syntactic
keyword <code>values</code> allows receiving all values as in <code>(let
(((values . xs) (foo x))) body)</code>. It also allows receiving no values at
all as in <code>(let (((values) (for-each foo list))) body)</code>.<br>
      <br>
      </p><p>A common application of binding multiple values
      is decomposing data structures into their components. This mechanism is
      illustrated in its most primitive form as follows: The procedure
      <code>uncons</code> (defined below) decomposes a pair <code>x</code> into
      its car and its cdr and delivers them as two values to its continuation.
      Then an extended <code>let</code> can receive these values:
      <pre>
(let ((car-x cdr-x (uncons x)))
  (foo car-x cdr-x))
</pre>
      </p><p>Of course, for pairs this method is probably
      neither faster nor clearer than using the procedures <code>car</code> and
      <code>cdr</code>. However, for data structures doing substantial work
      upon decomposition this is different: Extracting the element of highest
      priority from a priority queue, while at the same time constructing the
      residual queue, can both be more efficient and more convenient than doing
      both operations independently. In fact, the <code>quo-rem</code> example
      illustrates this point already as both quotient and remainder are
      probably computed by a common exact division algorithm. (And often
      caching is used to avoid executing this algorithm twice as often as
      needed.)
      </p><p>As the last feature of this SRFI, a mechanism
      is specified to store multiple values in heap-allocated data structures.
      For this purpose, <code>values->list</code> and
      <code>values->vector</code> construct a list (a vector, resp.) storing
      all values delivered by evaluating their argument expression. Note that
      these operations cannot be procedures.</p></blockquote></description><dc:creator>Sebastian Egner</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2005 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>SRFI 49: Indentation-sensitive syntax</title><link>https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-49/srfi-49.html</link><guid>https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-49</guid><description>SRFI 49 is now in <em>final</em> status.<blockquote>      <p>This SRFI descibes a new syntax for Scheme,

      <i>Revised Report</i> (<a href="http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/">R5RS</a>) in order to
      enable conforming implementations to use an extended character set such
      as (but not limited to) <a href="http://www.unicode.org">Unicode</a>.
      </p><p>Changes to some requirements of the report are
      recommended. Currently, the <i>Revised Report</i> contains requirements
      which are difficult or impossible to satisfy with some extended character
      sets.
      </p><p>New required procedures are proposed,
      specified, and included in the reference implementation. These procedures
      enable portable Scheme programs to manipulate Scheme source texts and
      source data accurately, even in implementations using extended character
      sets.
      </p><p>This SRFI concludes with some suggestions for
      implementors interested in providing good Unicode support, using these
      suggestions to illustrate how the proposed changes to the <i>Revised
      Report</i> can "play out" in Unicode-based Scheme.
      </p><p>This SRFI does <b>not</b> attempt to provide a
      comprehensive library for global text processing. For example, one issue
      in global text processing is the need for linguistically-sensitive,
      locale-sensitive procedures for sorting strings. Such procedures are
      beyond the scope of this SRFI. On the other hand, by making Scheme
      compatible with extended character sets, this SRFI is a step in the
      direction of permitting global text processing standard libraries to be
      developed in a form portable across all conforming
      implementations.
      </p><p>This SRFI does <b>not</b> propose that
      implementations be required to support Unicode or any other extended
      character set. It does not specify a representation for Unicode
      characters or strings. It <b>does</b> revise the specifications of the
      report so that <code>char?</code> values <i>may be</i> Unicode (or other)
      characters.
      </p><p>The reference implementation included should
      prove to be easily ported to and effective for all ASCII-only
      implementations and for many implementations using an 8-bit character set
      which is an extension of ASCII (it will require very minor modifications
      for each particular implementation). Other implementations may need to

      Scheme using <code>delay</code> and <code>force</code>. However, these
      primitives are not powerful enough to express a large class of lazy
      algorithms that are iterative. Indeed, it is folklore in the Scheme
      community that typical iterative lazy algorithms written using
      <code>delay</code> and <code>force</code> will often require unbounded
      memory.
      </p><p>Although varous modifications of
      <code>delay</code> and <code>force</code> had been proposed to resolve
      this problem (see e.g., the SRFI-40 discussion list) they all fail some
      of the benchmarks provided below. To our knowledge, the current SRFI
      provides the first exhaustive solution to this problem.
      </p><p>As motivation, we first explain how the usual
      laziness encoding using only <code>delay</code> and <code>force</code>
      will break the iterative behavior of typical algorithms that would have
      been properly tail-recursive in a true lazy language, causing the
      computation to require unbounded memory.
      </p><p>The problem is then resolved by introducing a
      set of three operations:
      <pre>
    {<code>lazy</code>, <code>delay</code>, <code>force</code>}
</pre>which allow the programmer to succinctly
express lazy algorithms while retaining bounded space behavior in cases that
are properly tail-recursive. A general recipe for using these primitives is
provided. An additional procedure <code>{eager}</code> is provided for the
construction of eager promises in cases where efficiency is a concern.<br>

      <br>
      </p><p>Although this SRFI redefines <code>delay</code>
      and <code>force</code>, the extension is conservative in the sense that
      the semantics of the subset {<code>delay</code>, <code>force</code>} in
      isolation (i.e., as long as the program does not use <code>lazy</code>)
      agrees with that in R5RS. In other words, no program that uses the R5RS
      definitions of delay and force will break if those definition are
      replaced by the SRFI-45 definitions of delay and force.</p></blockquote></description><dc:creator>Andr√© van Tonder</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2004 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>SRFI 44: Collections</title><link>https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-44/srfi-44.html</link><guid>https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-44</guid><description>SRFI 44 is now in <em>final</em> status.<blockquote>      <p>A Collections API which defines a common naming

      three different ways to use the interface, with varying demands on the
      quality of the source and the amount of control over the production
      process:
      <ul>
        <li>The "no fuss" interface specifies that
        <code>(random-integer</code> <i>n</i><code>)</code> produces the next
        random integer in {0, ..., <i>n</i>-1} and <code>(random-real)</code>
        produces the next random real number between zero and one. The details
        of how these random values are produced may not be very relevant, as
        long as they appear to be sufficiently random.
        </li><li>For simulation purposes, on the contrary, it
        is usually necessary to know that the numbers are produced
        deterministically by a pseudo random number generator of high quality
        and to have explicit access to its state. In addition, one might want
        to use several independent sources of random numbers at the same time
        and it can be useful to have some simple form of randomization.
        </li><li>For security applications a serious form of
        true randomization is essential, in the sense that it is difficult for
        an adversary to exploit or introduce imperfections into the
        distribution of random bits. Moreover, the linear complexity of the
        stream of random bits is more important than its statistical
        properties. In these applications, an entropy source (producing truely
        random bits at a low rate) is used to randomize a pseudo random number
        generator to increase the rate of available bits.
      </li></ul><li>
      <p>Once random sources provide the infrastructure
      to obtain random bits, these can be used to construct other random
      deviates. Most important are floating point numbers of various
      distributions and random discrete structures, such as permutations or
      graphs. As there is an essentially unlimited number of such objects (with
      limited use elsewhere), we do not include them in this SRFI. In other
      words, this SRFI is <em>not</em> about making all sorts of random
      objects---it is about obtaining random bits in a portable, flexible,
      reliable, and efficient way.</p></li></p></blockquote></description><dc:creator>Sebastian Egner</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2002 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>SRFI 25: Multi-dimensional Array Primitives</title><link>https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-25/srfi-25.html</link><guid>https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-25</guid><description>SRFI 25 is now in <em>final</em> status.<blockquote>      <p>A core set of procedures for creating and
      manipulating heterogeneous multidimensional arrays is proposed. The
      design is consistent with the rest of Scheme and independent of other
      container data types. It provides easy sharing of parts of an array as
      other arrays without copying, encouraging a declarative style of
      programming.
      </p><p>The specification is based on an original
      contribution by Alan Bawden in 1993.</p></blockquote></description><dc:creator>Jussi Piitulainen</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2002 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>SRFI 24: Define-syntax in local lexical scopes</title><link>https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-24/srfi-24.html</link><guid>https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-24</guid><description>SRFI 24 is now in <em>withdrawn</em> status.<blockquote>      <p>This document specifies a proper extension to

      frequently necessary to specialize some of the parameters of a
      multi-parameter procedure. For example, from the binary operation
      <code>cons</code> one might want to obtain the unary operation
      <code>(lambda (x) (cons 1 x))</code>. This specialization of parameters
      is also known as "partial application", "operator section" or
      "projection".
      </p><p>The mechanism proposed here allows to write
      this sort of specialization in a simple and compact way. The mechanism is
      best explained by a few examples:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><code>(cut cons (+ a 1) &lt;>)</code>
          </td><td>is the same as
          </td><td><code>(lambda (x2) (cons (+ a 1) x2))</code>
        <tr>
          <td><code>(cut list 1 &lt;> 3 &lt;> 5)</code>
          </td><td>is the same as
          </td><td><code>(lambda (x2 x4) (list 1 x2 3 x4 5))</code>
        <tr>
          <td><code>(cut list)</code>
          </td><td>is the same as
          </td><td><code>(lambda () (list))</code>
        <tr>
          <td><code>(cut list 1 &lt;> 3 &lt;...>)</code>
          </td><td>is the same as
          </td><td><code>(lambda (x2 . xs) (apply list 1 x2 3 xs))</code>
        <tr>
          <td><code>(cut &lt;> a b)</code>
          </td><td>is the same as
          </td><td><code>(lambda (f) (f a b))</code>
      </td></tr></td></tr></td></tr></td></tr></td></tr></table>
      </p><p>As you see, the macro <code>cut</code>
      specializes some of the parameters of its first argument. The parameters
      that are to show up as formal variables of the result are indicated by
      the symbol <code>&lt;></code>, pronouced as "slot". In addition, the
      symbol <code>&lt;...></code>, pronounced as "rest-slot", matches all
      residual arguments of a variable argument procedure. As you can see from
      the last example above, the first argument can also be a slot, as one
      should expect in Scheme.
      </p><p>In addition to <code>cut</code>, there is a
      variant called <code>cute</code> (a mnemonic for "<code>cut</code> with
      evaluated non-slots") which evaluates the non-slot expressions at the
      time the procedure is specialized, not at the time the specialized
      procedure is called. For example,
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><code>(cute cons (+ a 1) &lt;>)</code>
          </td><td>is the same as
          </td><td><code>(let ((a1 (+ a 1))) (lambda (x2) (cons a1 x2)))</code>
      </td></tr></table>
      </p><p>As you see from comparing this example with the
      first example above, the <code>cute</code>-variant will evaluate <code>(+
      a 1)</code> once, while the <code>cut</code>-variant will evaluate it
      during every invokation of the resulting procedure.
      </p><p>The mechanism proposed in this SRFI allows
      specializing any subset of the variables of a procedure. The result can
      be of fixed arity or of variable arity. The mechanism does not allow
      permutation, omission, duplication or any other processing of the
      arguments; for this it is necessary to write to use a different mechanism
      such as <code>lambda</code>.</p></blockquote></description><dc:creator>Sebastian Egner</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 14 Feb 2002 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>SRFI 22: Running Scheme Scripts on Unix</title><link>https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-22/srfi-22.html</link><guid>https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-22</guid><description>SRFI 22 is now in <em>final</em> status.<blockquote>      <p>This SRFI describes basic prerequisites for

      value of the location, when used as the first operand of

      additions to standard Scheme name those additions. SRFIs provide the
      specifications of these additions ("features"), and SRFI 0 provides the
      means to actually check that these features are present in the Scheme
      system by means of the <code>cond-expand</code> construct. It is
      anticipated that there will be two main classes of features:
      <ul>
        <li>sets of value and syntax bindings
        </li><li>reader syntax extensions
      </li></ul><li>
      <p>("Reader syntax" refers to aspects of the
      syntax described by the grammars in the Scheme reports.)
      </p><p>The former class of features will probably
      include most SRFIs, exemplified by the list library specified in <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-1/">SRFI 1</a>. The latter class includes Unicode source code
      support and different kinds of parentheses.
      </p><p>Control over the presence of individual
      features will vary over different Scheme systems. A given feature may be
      absent or provided by default in some Scheme systems and in others some
      mechanism (such as an "import" clause in the code or a program
      configuration file, a command line option, a dependency declaration in a
      module definition, etc.) will be required for the feature to be present
      in the system.
      </p><p>Moreover, in some systems a given feature may
      be in effect throughout the entire program if it is in effect anywhere at
      all. Other systems may have more precise mechanisms to control the scope
      of a feature (this might be the case for example when a module system is
      supported). In general it is thus possible that a feature is in effect in
      some parts of the program and not in others. This allows conflicting
      SRFIs to be present in a given program as long as their scope do not
      intersect.
      </p><p>SRFI 0 does not prescribe a particular
      mechanism for controlling the presence of a feature as it is our opinion
      that this should be the role of a module system. We expect that future
      module system SRFIs will need to extend the semantics of SRFI 0 for their
      purposes, for example by defining feature scoping rules or by
      generalizing the feature testing construct.</p></li></p></blockquote></description><dc:creator>Marc Feeley</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 07 May 1999 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>SRFI 5: A compatible let form with signatures and rest arguments</title><link>https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-5/srfi-5.html</link><guid>https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-5</guid><description>SRFI 5 is now in <em>final</em> status.<blockquote>      <p>The <i>named-let</i> incarnation of the
      <code>let</code> form has two slight inconsistencies with the
      <code>define</code> form. As defined, the <code>let</code> form makes no
      accommodation for rest arguments, an issue of functionality and
      consistency. As defined, the <code>let</code> form does not accommodate
      signature-style syntax, an issue of aesthetics and consistency. Both
      issues are addressed here in a manner which is compatible with the
      traditional <code>let</code> form but for minor extensions.</p></blockquote></description><dc:creator>Andy Gaynor</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 26 Apr 1999 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>SRFI 2: AND-LET*: an AND with local bindings, a guarded LET* special form</title><link>https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-2/srfi-2.html</link><guid>https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-2</guid><description>SRFI 2 is now in <em>final</em> status.<blockquote>      <p>Like an ordinary AND, an AND-LET* special form
